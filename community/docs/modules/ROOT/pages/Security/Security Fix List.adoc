|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0833[CVE-2023-0833] | 5.5 | FIXED | A flaw was found in Red Hat's AMQ-Streams, which ships a version of the OKHttp component with an information disclosure flaw via an exception triggered by a header containing an illegal value. |6.2024.1 | https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/6507[#6507] | Fixed by OKHttp Upgrade

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3635[CVE-2023-3635] | 7.5 | FIXED | GzipSource does not handle an exception that might be raised when parsing a malformed gzip buffer. This may lead to denial of service of the Okio client. | 6.2024.1 | https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/6507[#6507] | Fixed by OKHttp Upgrade

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-36374[CVE-2021-36374] | 5.5 | FIXED | A specially crafted ZIP archive can cause an out of memory error | 6.2023.12 | https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/6481[#6481] | Fixed by Apache Ant upgrade

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-36373[CVE-2021-36373] | 5.5 | FIXED | A specially crafted TAR archive can cause an out of memory error | 6.2023.12 | https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/6481[#6481] | Fixed by Apache Ant upgrade

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1945[CVE-2020-1945] | 6.3 | FIXED | Sensitive information may be leaked by the default temporary directory | 6.2023.12 | https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/6481[#6481] | Fixed by Apache Ant upgrade

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41699[CVE-2023-41699] | 6.1 | FIXED | URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') vulnerability in FORM authentication feature on root context | 6.2023.11 | https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/6464[#6464] | Fixed by porting fix from Apache Tomcat.

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1370[CVE-2023-1370] | 7.5 | FIXED | [Json-smart](https://netplex.github.io/json-smart/) is a performance focused, JSON processor lib. When reaching a ‘[‘ or ‘{‘ character in the JSON input, the code parses an array or an object respectively. It was discovered that the code does not have any limit to the nesting of such arrays or objects. Since the parsing of nested arrays and objects is done recursively, nesting too many of them can cause a stack exhaustion (stack overflow) and crash the software. | 6.2023.10 | https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/6280[#6280], https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/6418[#6418] | Fixed by upgrading shaded json-smart version on Ecosystem Security submodule.

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12617[CVE-2017-12617] | 8.1 | FIXED | When running Apache Tomcat versions 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0, 8.5.0 to 8.5.22, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.46 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.81 with HTTP PUTs enabled (e.g. via setting the readonly initialisation parameter of the Default servlet to false) it was possible to upload a JSP file to the server via a specially crafted request. This JSP could then be requested and any code it contained would be executed by the server. | 6.2023.9 | https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/6374[#6374] | Fixed by porting solution from Tomcat.

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1370[CVE-2023-1370] | 7.5 | FIXED | Json-smart is a library used by Payara Server for processing JSON in our implementations of MicroProfile. It was discovered that Json-smart does not limit the nesting of arrays or objects, the parsing of which is done recursively, and could lead to stack exhaustion and crash the software.  | 6.2.0 | https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/6280[#6280] | Fixed by updating Json-smart to 2.4.10.

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0265[CVE-2022-0265] | 9.8 | FIXED | Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference in GitHub repository hazelcast/hazelcast in 5.1-BETA-1.  ||| This can only be triggered if explicitly using hazelcast to parse XML data.

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28462[CVE-2023-28462] | 9.8 | N/A |JNDI Exploit using `context.rebind` method when running Payara Server on an older JDK 8 Update. The JNDI exploit can be triggered via access to insecure ORB listeners exposed by a Payara Server installation.  ||| This issue doesn't affect Payara Server Community as Java 11 is the minimum Java version required to run it.

NOTE: It is ALWAYS recommended to properly secure or disable any public facing ORB listeners, even if the exploit cannot be triggered.

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471[CVE-2022-1471] | 9.8 | FIXED | SnakeYaml's Constructor() class does not restrict types which can be instantiated during deserialization. Deserializing yaml content provided by an attacker can lead to remote code execution | 6.2023.5 | https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/6276[#6276] | SnakeYaml constructors are not used by any features or facilities, so this vulnerability doesn't affect Payara Platform Community. Fixed by updating SnakeYaml to 2.0.

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2068[CVE-2022-2068] | 9.8 | FIXED | In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection were found by code review. | 6.2023.1 | https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/6104[#6104] | Fixed by removing OpenSSL from Payara Docker Images

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1292[CVE-2022-1292] | 9.8 | FIXED | The c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the `c_rehash` script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. | 6.2023.1 | https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/6104[#6104] | Fixed by removing OpenSSL from Payara Docker Images

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42920[CVE-2022-42920] | 9.8 | FIXED | Apache Commons BCEL has a number of APIs that would normally only allow changing specific class characteristics. However, due to an out-of-bounds writing issue, these APIs can be used to produce arbitrary bytecode. This could be abused in applications that pass attacker-controllable data to those APIs, giving the attacker more control over the resulting bytecode than otherwise expected. | 6.2022.2 | https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/6056[#6056] | Fixed by upgrading Apache BCEL to 6.6.1

|https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-45129[CVE-2022-45129] | N/A | FIXED | A vulnerability exploit opens up to attackers a way to explore the contents of the WEB-INF and META-INF folders if an application is deployed to the root context. | 6.2022.1 |https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/5989[#5989]| Internal fix on Servlet engine

The fix in the Payara Platform mitigates the Spring vulnerability by blocking the Payara classloader from giving access to Payara Platform internals.

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42392[CVE-2021-42392] | N/A | N/A | Unauthenticated RCE in H2 Database Console |  |  | Doesn't affect Payara Platform. The Payara Platform doesn't launch the H2 Database Console and doesn't make it available in any way.

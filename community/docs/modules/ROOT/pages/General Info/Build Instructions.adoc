:ordinal: 3

This page provides instructions on how to build the Payara Server's source code.

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

To build and run Payara Server, your environment must be set up with the following:

* Oracle _JDK 11 Update 5_ or later.
* Maven 3.3.9 or above
* Git
* A `JAVA_HOME` environment variable pointing to the JDK install location (e.g. _/home/user/jdk11.0.16.1_)
* A `PATH` environment variable that has a pointer to the Java binaries (`JAVA_HOME/bin`)

You can also optionally add the Maven _bin_ folder to the `PATH` environment variable as well, and the documentation will assume that you have done so.


[[getting-the-source-code]]
== Getting the Source Code

To download the Payara Server's source code, open a terminal or Git Bash window, navigate to the directory you would like the source code to be downloaded to, and run `git clone https://github.com/payara/Payara.git`.

This will download the Payara Server's source code, and initialize **git**, in a directory called _Payara_.

[[building-payara-server]]
== Building Payara Server

With your Git Bash or terminal window, navigate into the downloaded _Payara_  directory, and run:

[source, shell]
----
mvn clean install
----

This will build Payara and run the integrated unit tests. To save a bit of time, you can skip these tests by appending the _skipTests_ flag to the install command like so:

[source, shell]
----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----

[[building-payara-micro]]
== Building Payara Micro

Payara Micro is included as part of the default build. As it depends on modules of Payara Server, it can't be built on its own. To build Payara Micro:

[source, shell]
----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----

After the build has completed, the Payara Micro jar can be found in the target directory at:

----
appserver/extras/payara-micro/payara-micro-distribution/target/
----

[[building-docker-images]]
== Building Payara Docker Images

The source code of the Official Docker Images is also integrated in the main Payara repository. In order to be able to build these images, a Docker Client needs to be installed on the machine you execute the Maven command. 

[source, shell]
----
mvn clean install -PBuildDockerImages -pl :docker-images -amd
----

The Maven build expects that a regular build of Payara is already executed as it searches for some artifacts in the Maven repository (like SNAPSHOT builds of the server)

The build configuration of the Docker images is also set up to create multiplatform images using _buildx_.
This can be activated to by specifying at the command line the `-Ddocker.platforms` system property like so:

[source, shell]
----
mvn clean install -PBuildDockerImages -pl :docker-images -amd -Ddocker.platforms=linux/amd64,linux/arm64
----

The JDK Docker images that Payara pull from currently only provide multiplatform images for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`,
so be aware that specifying other platforms may require editing the Dockerfiles and build config.

[[additional-build-profiles]]
== Additional Build Profiles

There are a number of additional Maven build profiles:

[source, shell]
----
mvn clean install
mvn clean install -PBuildEmbedded
mvn clean install -PQuickBuild
----

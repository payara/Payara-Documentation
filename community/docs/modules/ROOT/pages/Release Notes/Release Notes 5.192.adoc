= Payara Server 5.192 Release Notes

[[supported-apis-and-applications]]
== Supported APIs and Applications

* Java EE 8 Applications
* MicroProfile 2.2

== Notes

=== Domain.xml Changes

At long last, Payara Platform is shipping with support for JDK 11. It should be
stressed that firstly: this support is in tech preview and secondly: if
upgrading from an older version of Payara, you’ll need to add some extra JVM
options to your domain.xml configuration files. These are documented in the
https://docs.payara.fish/Technical Documentation/user-guides/upgrade-payara.html#jdk-11-upgrade-considerations[release
documentation].

=== MicroProfile Changes

This release also brings our support of MicroProfile up to 2.2, providing
updates to OpenAPI, Rest Client, and Fault Tolerance.

=== Docker Integration Changes

Finally, this release introduces the concept of a Docker node (also tech
preview) as our first iteration of better native Docker integration. These
function similarly to existing nodes, except the instances created for a Docker
node are run within Docker containers.

=== Removal of System Property

The system property `java.ext.dirs` is no longer supported. This also means that
JAR files within the `<payara-home>/glassfish/domains/<domain>/lib/ext` directory are no longer placed on the classpath.
The `<payara-home>/glassfish/domains/<domain>/lib` directory is the preferred place to put these additional JAR files or
the `asadmin add-library` command can be used to place it there for you.

Also the System property `java.endorsed.dirs` is no longer supported.

== Known Issues

- [PAYARA-3865] - Output of asadmin osgi commands is not displayed. The issue was discovered later in release cycle. Workaround is to use OSGi shell over
telnet. The server can be started by issuing command asadmin osgi telnetd start.

= Eclipse MicroProfile Fault Tolerance API

Payara Server {page-version} provides MicroProfile Fault Tolerance {mpFaultToleranceVersion}

== Background

The Fault Tolerance API was created to help separate execution logic from execution. The execution can be configured with a number of fault tolerance policies.

{mpFaultToleranceSpecUrl}[The complete specification] can be found on the Eclipse MicroProfile website.

Breaking changes introduced in MicroProfile Fault Tolerance {mpFaultToleranceVersion} are listed in the official specification under {mpFaultToleranceSpecUrl}#_backward_incompatible_changes[Backwards Incompatible Changes]

== Additions to the Fault Tolerance Spec

In addition to the functionality https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/microprofile-fault-tolerance-spec.asciidoc[detailed in the spec], the following is also implemented in Payara Server and Payara Micro:

=== Configurable Executor Services
The managed and scheduled managed executor pool can be configured via the _set-fault-tolerance-configuration_ asadmin command.

The executor service is used to execute methods annotated with `@Asynchronous`, whereas the scheduled executor service is used by the CircuitBreaker and Timeout interceptors for their timeout operations (scheduling the circuit breaker to be set to half open, and just timing out respectively).

=== Alternative @Asynchronous Annotations

The Payara Platform specific configuration property `MP_Fault_Tolerance_Alternative_Asynchronous_Annotations` can be used to specify a comma separated list of fully qualified class names of those annotations that should have the same effect as FT's `@Asynchronous`. These annotations do not have to be interceptor bindings.

For example:

----
MP_Fault_Tolerance_Alternative_Asynchronous_Annotations=javax.ejb.Asynchronous
----

[[annotation-priority]]
=== Annotation Priority

Since the asynchronous annotation is invoked first, if it's combined with any other fault tolerance annotations they will be processed on the asynchronous thread.

Interactions between annotations are handled as described by the {mpFaultToleranceVersion} specification effectively nesting computation in the following way (skipping handling for annotations not present):

. Asynchronous
. Fallback
. Retry
. Circuit Breaker
. Timeout
. Bulkhead
. (calling annotated method; might be wrapped by other interceptors)

As specified the interceptor priority can be changed using the property `mp.fault.tolerance.interceptor.priority` affecting all annotations including alternative ones.

[[fault-tolerance-configuration]]
== Fault Tolerance Configuration

Fault Tolerance can be configured by using Admin Console or Asadmin commands.

[[using-the-admin-console]]
=== Using the Admin Console

To configure the Fault Tolerance in the Admin Console, go to Configuration → [instance-configuration (like server-config)] → MicroProfile → Fault Tolerance:

[[using-asadmin-commands]]
=== Using Asadmin Commands

[[set-fault-tolerance-configuration]]
==== `set-fault-tolerance-configuration`

*Usage*::

[source, shell]
----
asadmin>set-fault-tolerance-configuration
  [--managedexecutorservicename=managedexecutorservicename]
  [--managedscheduledexecutorservicename=managedscheduledexecutorservicename]
  [--target=server-config]
----

*Aim*:: Provides a way to set the configuration of the fault tolerance service of the targeted config.

===== Command Options

NOTE: Starting from Payara Platform release 5.2021.2, the options `asyncmaxpoolsize` and `delaymaxpoolsize` have been removed as they are no longer applicable due to the configurable managed executor pools being used.

[cols="4,10,1,1", options="header"]

|Option
|Description
|Default
|Mandatory

|`managedexecutorservicename`
|The Logical JNDI name of the Managed Executor Service to look up. Changes to this configuration require a restart of the server to take effect.
|`java:comp/DefaultManagedExecutorService`
|no

|`managedscheduledexecutorservicename`
|The Logical JNDI name of the Managed Scheduled Executor Service to look up. Changes to this configuration require a restart of the server to take effect.

|no

|`target`
|The target configuration object to apply the change to
|`server`
|no

===== Example

[source,Shell]
----
asadmin> set-fault-tolerance-configuration --managedexecutorservicename=java:comp/DefaultManagedExecutorService --target instance1
----

[[get-fault-tolerance-configuration]]
==== `get-fault-tolerance-configuration`

*Usage*:: `asadmin> get-fault-tolerance-configuration [--target=server-config]`
*Aim*:: Returns the current configuration options for the Fault Tolerance service on the targeted config.

= Eclipse MicroProfile Health Check API

Payara Server {page-version} provides MicroProfile HealthCheck {mpHealthVersion}

[[background]]
== Background

The Health Check API was created to allow easier probing of the state of computing nodes that live in a cloud infrastructure environment.

{mpHealthSpecUrl}[The complete specification] can be found on the Eclipse MicroProfile website.

Breaking changes introduced in MicroProfile Health {mpHealthVersion} are listed in the official specification under {mpOpenAPISpecUrl}#_incompatible_changes[Incompatible Changes]

[[rest-endpoints]]
== REST Endpoints

The MicroProfile HealthCheck API defines the following list of REST endpoints that are available from the root context at `/health/${type}` by default:

[cols="1,1,10", options="header"]
|====
|Context
|Type
|Description

|`/health/live`
|Liveness
|On invocation, all registered health checks annotated with `@Liveness` are performed and the results aggregated.

|`/health/ready`
|Readiness
|On invocation, all registered health checks annotated with `@Readiness` are performed and the results aggregated.

|'/health/started'
|Startup
|On invocation, all registered health checks annotated with '@Startup' are performed and the results aggregated.

|`/health`
|Readiness + Liveness + Startup
|On invocation, all registered health checks annotated with `@Liveness`, `@Readiness`, or `@Startup are performed and the results aggregated.
|====

This root endpoint can be altered using the `set-microprofile-healthcheck-configuration` asadmin command to prevent collisions with other HTTP endpoints that might need to use the `health` context root.

NOTE: This endpoint will not be available until at least one application has been deployed.

[[health-check-configuration]]
== Health Check Configuration

Health Check can be configured by using Admin Console or Asadmin commands. 

[[using-the-admin-console]]
=== Using the Admin Console

To configure the Health Check in the Admin Console, go to Configuration → [instance-configuration (like server-config)] → MicroProfile → Health Check:

[[using-asadmin-commands]]
=== Using Asadmin Commands

The following administration commands can be used to configure the MicroProfile Healthcheck service:

[[set-microprofile-healthcheck-configuration]]
==== `set-microprofile-healthcheck-configuration`

*Usage*::
----
asadmin set-microprofile-healthcheck-configuration 
        [--enabled=true|false]
        [--securityenabled=true|false]
        [--roles=<role-list>] 
        [--endpoint=<context-root[default:health]>] 
        [--target=<target[default:server]>]
        [--virtualservers=<virtualserver-list>]
----
*Aim*::
Enables or disables the MicroProfile HealthCheck service and configures the endpoint where all registered health checks are exposed.

[[command-options]]

|If defined, the endpoint will be assigned to a list of the role specified as a comma-separated.
|`microprofile`
|No

|`endpoint`
|String
|The context root used to expose the health checks endpoint.
|health
|No

|`target`
|String
|The target configuration where the command should be run
|server
|No

|`virtualservers`
|String
|If defined, the '/health' endpoint will be assigned to the list of virtual servers specified as a comma-separated list of names. Otherwise, the endpoint will be assigned to all virtual servers available.
|-
|No
|====

IMPORTANT: Changes made with this command will only be applied when the server or instance is restarted.

[[security-configuration]]
=== Security Configuration
By default, HealthCheck endpoints bind to the root context application which is the `__default-web-module` (also known as *docroot*) system application and the `__default-web-module` application, which is secured under the default realm (`file`) of the server. 

If a user application is deployed in the empty context-root, then the security configuration of this application will be shared by the HealthCheck endpoints, so exert extreme caution when making these changes.

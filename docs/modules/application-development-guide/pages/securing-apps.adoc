[[securing-applications]]
= Securing Applications

This chapter describes how to write secure Jakarta EE applications, which contain components that perform user authentication and access authorization for the business logic of Jakarta EE components.

For general information about Jakarta EE security, see https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-tutorial/#security-2[Security] in The Jakarta EE Tutorial.

NOTE: Payara Server's Web Profile supports the EJB 4.0+ specification, which allows enterprise beans within web applications, among other features. The Full Profile supports the entire EJB 4.0+ specification. For details, see https://jakarta.ee/specifications/enterprise-beans[Jakarta Enterprise Beans].

[[security-goals]]
== Security Goals

In an enterprise computing environment, there are many security risks.
The goal of Payara Server is to provide highly secure, interoperable, and distributed component computing based on the Jakarta EE security model. Security goals include:

* Full compliance with the Jakarta EE security model. This includes EJB and servlet role-based authorization.
* Full compliance with Eclipse MicroProfile JWT Propagation API.
* Support for single sign-on across all Payara Server applications within a single security domain.
* Support for web services message security.
* Security support for application clients.

* Support for the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/authentication/[Jakarta Authentication API].
* Support for the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/authorization/[Jakarta Authorization API].
* Support for Web Services Interoperability Technologies (WSIT) as described in the https://javaee.github.io/metro/doc/user-guide/index.html[Metro Users Guide].
* Support for the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/[Jakarta Security API]
* Support for several underlying security realms, such as simple file, JDBC and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) configurable realms.
+
Certificate authentication is also supported for Secure Socket Layer (SSL) client authentication.
+
NOTE: For Solaris, OS platform authentication is supported in addition to these.
* Support for declarative security through Payara Server specific XML-based role mapping.
* Support for https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect] compatible security features (such as OAuth2 and Yubikey).

[[payara-server-specific-security-features]]
== Payara Server Specific Security Features

Payara Server supports the Jakarta EE Platform's security model (and added features courtesy of Eclipse MicroProfile APIs), as well as the following features which are specific to it:

* Message security; see xref:securing-apps.adoc#configuring-message-security-for-web-services[Configuring Message Security for Web Services]
* Single sign-on across all Payara Server applications within a single security domain; see xref:securing-apps.adoc#user-authentication-for-single-sign-on[User Authentication for Single Sign-on]
* Programmatic login; see xref:securing-apps.adoc#programmatic-login-using-the-programmaticlogin-class[Programmatic Login Using the ProgrammaticLogin Class]
* OAuth2 and Yubikey integration support.

[[container-security]]
== Container Security

The component containers are responsible for providing Jakarta EE application security. The container provides two security forms:

* xref:securing-apps.adoc#declarative-security[Declarative Security]
* xref:securing-apps.adoc#programmatic-security[Programmatic Security]

Annotations (also called metadata) enable a declarative style of programming, and so encompass both the declarative and programmatic security concepts. Users can specify information about security within a class file using annotations.

When an application is deployed, this information can either be used by or overridden by the application or module deployment descriptors.

[[declarative-security]]
=== Declarative Security

Declarative security means that the security mechanism for an application is declared and handled externally to the application.

Deployment descriptors describe the Jakarta EE application's security structure, including security roles, access control, and authentication requirements.

Payara Server supports the deployment descriptors specified by Jakarta EE and has additional security elements included in its own deployment descriptors. Declarative security is the application deployer's responsibility.

There are two levels of declarative security, as follows:

* xref:securing-apps.adoc#application-level-security[Application Level Security]
* xref:securing-apps.adoc#component-level-security[Component Level Security]

[[application-level-security]]
==== Application Level Security

For an application, roles used by any application must be defined in `@DeclareRoles` annotations in the code or `role-name` elements in the application deployment descriptor (`application.xml`).

These role names are scoped to the EJB XML deployment descriptors (`ejb-jar.xml` and `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml` files) and to the servlet XML deployment descriptors (`web.xml` and `payara-web.xml` files).

For an individually deployed web or EJB module, you define roles using `@DeclareRoles` annotations or `role-name` elements in the Jakarta EE deployment descriptor files `web.xml` or `ejb-jar.xml`.

To map roles to principals and groups, define matching `security-role-mapping` elements in the `glassfish-application.xml`, `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml`, or `glassfish-web.xml`/`payara-web.xml` file for each `role-name` used by the application.

By default, group principal names are mapped to roles of the same name.
Accordingly, the *Default Principal To Role Mapping* setting is enabled by default on the _Security_ page of the Payara Server Administration Console.

TIP: This default role mapping definition is in effect if you do not define your own mapping in the deployment descriptor for your application as described in this section.

[[component-level-security]]
==== Component Level Security

Component level security encompasses web components and EJB components.

A secure web container authenticates users and authorizes access to a servlet or JSP by using the security policy laid out in the servlet XML deployment descriptors (`web.xml`, `glassfish-web.xml` and `payara-web.xml` files).

The EJB container is responsible for authorizing access to a bean method by using the security policy laid out in the EJB XML deployment descriptors (`ejb-jar.xml` and `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml` files).

[[programmatic-security]]
=== Programmatic Security

Programmatic security involves an EJB component or servlet using method calls to the security API, as specified by the Jakarta EE security model, to make business logic decisions based on the caller or remote user's security role.

Programmatic security should only be used when declarative security alone is insufficient to meet the application's security model.

The API for programmatic security consists of methods of the Jakarta Security API `SecurityContext` interface, and methods of the EJB `EJBContext` interface and the servlet `HttpServletRequest` interface.

Payara Server supports these interfaces as specified in the Jakarta EE specification.

There is also a proprietary Payara API for programmatic login. See xref:securing-apps.adoc#programmatic-login-using-the-programmaticlogin-class[Programmatic Login Using the ProgrammaticLogin Class].

For more information about programmatic security in web applications, see https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-tutorial/#using-programmatic-security-with-web-applications[Using Programmatic Security with Web Applications] in the Jakarta EE Tutorial.

[[roles-principals-and-principal-to-role-mapping]]
== Roles, Principals, and Principal to Role Mapping

By default, any groups that an authenticated user belongs to will be mapped to roles with the same names.

Therefore, the *Default Principal To Role Mapping* setting is enabled by default on the _Security_ page of the Payara Administration Console. To change the default mapping you can clear this setting.

For applications, you define roles in `@DeclareRoles` annotations or the Jakarta EE deployment descriptor file `application.xml`. You define the corresponding role mappings in the Payara Server deployment descriptor file `glassfish-application.xml`.

For individually deployed web or EJB modules, you define roles in `@DeclareRoles` annotations or the Jakarta EE deployment descriptor files `web.xml` or `ejb-jar.xml`. You define the corresponding role mappings in the Payara Server deployment descriptor files `glassfish-web.xml`/`payara-web.xml` or `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml`.

For more information regarding Jakarta EE deployment descriptors, see the Jakarta EE Specification. For more information regarding Payara Server deployment descriptors, see "xref:docs:application-deployment-guide:dd-elements.adoc#elements-of-the-payara-server-deployment-descriptors[Elements of the Payara Server Deployment Descriptors]" in Payara Server Application Deployment Guide.

Each `security-role-mapping` element in the `glassfish-application.xml`, `glassfish-web.xml`/`payara-web.xml`, or `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml` file maps a role name permitted by the application or module to principals and groups.

For example, a `payara-web.xml` file for an individually deployed web module might contain the following:

[source,xml]
----
<payara-web-app>
    <security-role-mapping>
        <role-name>manager</role-name>
        <principal-name>jgarcia</principal-name>
        <principal-name>mwebster</principal-name>
        <group-name>team-leads</group-name>
    </security-role-mapping>
    <security-role-mapping>
        <role-name>administrator</role-name>
        <principal-name>dsmith</principal-name>
    </security-role-mapping>
</payara-web-app>
----

A role can be mapped to either specific principals or to groups (or both). The principal or group names used must be valid principals or groups in the realm for the application or module.

Note that the `role-name` in this example must match the `@DeclareRoles` annotations or the `role-name` in the `security-role` element of the corresponding `web.xml` file.

You can also specify a custom principal implementation class. This provides more flexibility in how principals can be assigned to roles.

A user's Jakarta Authentication login module now can authenticate its custom principal, and the authenticated custom principal can further participate in the Payara Server's authorization process. For example:

[source,xml]
----
<security-role-mapping>
    <role-name>administrator</role-name>
    <principal-name class-name="CustomPrincipalImplClass">dsmith</principal-name>
</security-role-mapping>
----

You can specify a default principal and a default principal to role mapping, each of which applies to the entire Payara Server instance. The default principal to role-mapping maps group principals to the same named roles.

Web modules that omit the `run-as` element in `web.xml` use the default principal. Applications and modules that omit the `security-role-mapping` element use the default principal to role mapping. These defaults settings are part of the _Security Service_, which you can access in the following ways:

* In the Administration Console, select the _Security_ component under the relevant configuration.
* Use the `asadmin set` command. For example, you can set the default principal as follows:
+
[source,shell]
----
asadmin set server-config.security-service.default-principal=dsmith
asadmin set server-config.security-service.default-principal-password=secret
----
You can set the default principal to role mapping as follows.
+
[source,shell]
----
asadmin set server-config.security-service.activate-default-principal-to-role-mapping=true
asadmin set server-config.security-service.mapped-principal-class=CustomPrincipalImplClass
----
+
Default principal to role mapping is enabled by default. To disable it, set the default principal to role mapping property to `false`.

[[realm-configuration]]
== Realm Configuration

[[supported-realms]]
=== Supported Security Realms

The following security realms are supported:

* `file` - Stores user information in a file. This is the default realm.
* `ldap` - Stores user information in an LDAP directory.
* `jdbc` - Stores user information in a database.
+
In the JDBC realm, the server gets user credentials from a database Payara Server uses the database information and the enabled JDBC realm option in the configuration file.
+
For digest authentication, a JDBC realm should be created with `jdbcDigestRealm` as the JAAS context.

* `certificate` - Sets up the user identity in the Payara Server's security context, and populates it with user data obtained from cryptographically verified client certificates.

* `solaris` - Allows authentication using Solaris `username+password` data.
+
NOTE: This realm is only supported on the Solaris operating system, version 9 and above

[[how-to-configure-a-realm]]
=== How to Configure a Security Realm

You can configure a realm in one of these ways:

* In the Administration Console, open the _Security_ component under the relevant configuration and go to the _Realms_ page.
* Use the `asadmin create-auth-realm` command to create a new security realms.

[[how-to-set-a-realm-for-an-application-or-module]]
=== How to Set a Realm for an Application or Module

The following deployment descriptor elements have optional `realm` or `realm-name` data sub-elements or attributes that override the domain's default realm:

* `glassfish-application` element in `glassfish-application.xml`
* `web-app` element in `web.xml`
* `as-context` element in `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml`
* `client-container` element in `sun-acc.xml`
* `client-credential` element in `sun-acc.xml`

If modules within an application specify realms, these are ignored. If present, the realm defined in `glassfish-application.xml` is used, otherwise the domain's default realm is used.

For example, a realm is specified in `glassfish-application.xml` as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<glassfish-application>
    ...
    <realm>ldap</realm>
</glassfish-application>
----

For more information about the deployment descriptor files and elements, see "xref:docs:application-deployment-guide:dd-elements.adoc#elements-of-the-payara-server-deployment-descriptors[Elements of the Payara Server Deployment Descriptors]" in the Payara Server Application Deployment Guide.

[[creating-a-custom-realm]]
=== Creating a Custom Realm

You can create a custom security realm by providing a custom Jakarta Authentication login module class and a custom security realm class.

CAUTION: Client-side login modules are not suitable for use with Payara Server.

To activate custom login modules and security realms, place their corresponding JAR files in the `${DOMAIN}/lib` directory or the class files in the `${DOMAIN}/lib/classes` directory.

For more information about class loading in the Payara Server, see xref:docs:application-development-guide:class-loaders.adoc#class-loaders[Class Loaders].

Jakarta Authentication is a set of APIs that enable services to authenticate and enforce access controls upon users. They provide a pluggable and extensible framework for programmatic user authentication and authorization.

For Javadoc tool pages relevant to custom realms, see the `com.sun.appserv.security` package.

Custom login modules must extend the `com.sun.appserv.security.AppservPasswordLoginModule` class. This class implements `jakarta.security.auth.spi.LoginModule`.

IMPORTANT: Custom login modules must not implement the `LoginModule` interface directly.

Custom login modules must provide an implementation for one `abstract` method defined in the `AppservPasswordLoginModule` class:

[source,java]
----
abstract protected void authenticateUser() throws LoginException;
----

This method performs the actual authentication. The custom login module must not implement any of the other methods, such as `login`, `logout`,
`abort`, `commit`, or `initialize`.

TIP: Default implementations are provided in `AppservPasswordLoginModule` which hook into the Payara Server infrastructure.

The custom login module can access the following protected object fields, which it inherits from `AppservPasswordLoginModule`. These contain the username and password credentials of the user to be authenticated:

[source, java]
----
protected String _username;
protected String _password;
----

The `authenticateUser` method must end with the following code sequence:

[source,java]
----
String[] grpList;
// populate grpList with the set of groups to which
// _username belongs in this realm, if any
commitUserAuthentication(grpList);
----

Custom security realms must extend the `com.sun.appserv.security.AppservRealm` class and implement the following methods:

---
[source,java]
----
public void init(Properties props) throws BadRealmException, NoSuchRealmException;
----

This method is invoked during server startup when the realm is initially loaded. The `props` argument contains the configuration properties defined for this realm. The realm can do any initialization it needs in this method.

If the method returns without throwing an exception, Payara Server assumes that the realm is ready to service authentication requests. If an exception is thrown, the realm is disabled.

---
[source,java]
----
public String getAuthType();
----

This method returns a descriptive string representing the type of authentication done by this realm.

---
[source, java]
----
public abstract Enumeration getGroupNames(String username) throws InvalidOperationException, NoSuchUserException;
----

This method returns an `Enumeration` (of `String` objects) enumerating the groups (if any) to which the given `username` belongs in this realm.

Custom realms that manage users must implement the following additional methods:

---
[source,java]
----
public abstract boolean supportsUserManagement();
----

This method returns `true` if the realm supports user management.

---
[source,java]
----
public abstract Enumeration getGroupNames() throws BadRealmException;
----

This method returns an `Enumeration` of all group names.

---
[source,java]
----
public abstract Enumeration getUserNames() throws BadRealmException;
----

This method returns an `Enumeration` of all usernames.

---
[source,java]
----
public abstract void refresh() throws BadRealmException;
----

This method refreshes the realm data so that new users and groups are visible.

---
[source,java]
----
public abstract void persist() throws BadRealmException;
----

This method persists the realm data to permanent storage.

---
[source,java]
----
public abstract User getUser(String name) throws NoSuchUserException,BadRealmException;
----

This method returns the information recorded about a particular named user.

---
[source,java]
----
public abstract void addUser(String name, String password, String[] groupList) throws BadRealmException, IASSecurityException;
----

This method adds a new user, who cannot already exist in the realm's storage.

---
[source,java]
----
public abstract void removeUser(String name) throws NoSuchUserException, 
BadRealmException;
----

This method removes a user, who must exist in the realm's storage.

---
[source,java]
----
public abstract void updateUser(String name, String newName, String password, String[] groups) throws NoSuchUserException, BadRealmException, IASSecurityException;
----

This method updates data for a user, who must exist.

---

NOTE: The array passed to the `commitUseAuthentication` method should be newly created and otherwise unreferenced. This is because the group name array elements are set to null after authentication as part of cleanup.
+
So the second time your custom realm executes it returns an array with `null` elements. +

Ideally, your custom realm should not return member variables from the `authenticate` method. It should return local variables
Your custom realm can create a local `String` array in its `authenticate` method, copy the values from the member variables, and return the `String` array.

[[pluggable-audit-module-support]]
== Pluggable Audit Module Support

Audit modules collect and store information on incoming requests (servlets, EJB components) and outgoing responses. You can create a custom audit module.

[[configuring-an-audit-module]]
=== Configuring an Audit Module

To configure an audit module, you can perform one of the following tasks:

* To specify an audit module using the Administration Console, open the _Security_ component under the relevant configuration, and select the _Audit Modules_ component.
* You can use the `asadmin create-audit-module` command to configure an audit module.

[[the-auditmodule-class]]
=== The `AuditModule` Class

You can create a custom audit module by implementing a class that extends the `com.sun.enterprise.security.audit.AuditModule` class.

For Javadoc tool pages relevant to audit modules, see the `com.sun.enterprise.security.audit` package.

The `AuditModule` class provides default "no-op" implementations for each of the following methods, which your custom class can override.

---
[source,java]
----
public void init(Properties props);
----

The preceding method is invoked during server startup when the audit module is initially loaded. The `props` argument contains the configuration properties defined for this module. The module can do any initialization it needs in this method. If the method returns without throwing an exception, Payara Server assumes the module realm is ready to service audit requests. If an exception is thrown, the module is disabled.

---
[source,java]
----
public void authentication(String user, String realm, boolean success);
----

This method is invoked when an authentication request has been processed by a realm for the given user. The `success` flag indicates whether the authorization was granted or denied.

---
[source,java]
----
public void webInvocation(String user, HttpServletRequest req, String type, boolean success);
----

This method is invoked when a web container call has been processed by authorization. The `success` flag indicates whether the authorization was granted or denied. The `req` object is the standard `HttpServletRequest` object for this request.

NOTE: The `type` string is one of `hasUserDataPermission` or `hasResourcePermission`.

---
[source,java]
----
public void ejbInvocation(String user, String ejb, String method, boolean success)
----

This method is invoked when an EJB container call has been processed by authorization. The `success` flag indicates whether the authorization was granted or denied.

NOTE: The `ejb` and `method` strings describe the EJB component and its method that is being invoked.

---
[source,java]
----
public void webServiceInvocation(String uri, String endpoint, boolean success);
----

This method is invoked during validation of a web service request in which the endpoint is a servlet. The `uri` is the URL representation of the web service endpoint.

NOTE: The `endpoint` is the name of the endpoint representation. The `success` flag indicates whether the authorization was granted or denied.

---
[source,java]
----
public void ejbAsWebServiceInvocation(String endpoint, boolean success);
----

This method is invoked during validation of a web service request in which the endpoint is a stateless session bean. The `endpoint` is the name of the endpoint representation. The `success` flag indicates whether the authorization was granted or denied.

[[the-server.policy-file]]
== The `server.policy` File

Each Payara Server domain has its own global Java policy file, located in `${DOMAIN_DIR}/config`. The file is named `server.policy`.

Payara Server is a Jakarta EE compliant application server. As such, it follows the requirements of the Jakarta EE specification, including the ability to run application components in the presence of a security manager (the internal Java component that enforces the policy) and a limited permission set for Jakarta EE application code.

[[default-permissions]]
=== Default Permissions

Internal server code is granted all permissions. These are covered by the `AllPermission` grant blocks to various parts of the server infrastructure code.

Application permissions are granted in the default `grant` block. These permissions apply to all code not part of the internal server code listed previously.Payara Server does not distinguish between EJB and web module permissions.

All code is granted the minimal set of web component permissions (which is a superset of the EJB minimal set).

A few permissions above the minimal set are also granted in the default `server.policy` file. These are necessary due to various internal dependencies of the server implementation. Jakarta EE application developers must not rely on these additional permissions.

In some cases, deleting these permissions might be appropriate. For example, one additional permission is granted specifically for using connectors. If connectors are not used in a particular domain, you should remove this permission, because it is not otherwise necessary.

CAUTION: Unless strictly required, do not modify the entries for the default permissions under any circumstance.

[[system-properties]]
=== System Properties

The following predefined system properties, also called system variables, are available for use in the `server.policy` file.

NOTE: The system property most frequently used in the `server.policy` file is `${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}`.

.Predefined System Properties
[cols="2,3,4a", options="header"]
|===
|Property |Default |Description

|`com.sun.aas.installRoot` |Depends on operating system |Specifies the directory where Payara Server is installed.

|`com.sun.aas.instanceRoot` |Depends on operating system |Specifies the top level directory for a server instance.

|`com.sun.aas.hostName` |`none` |Specifies the name of the host (machine).

|`com.sun.aas.javaRoot` |Depends on operating system |Specifies the installation directory for the Java runtime.

|`com.sun.aas.imqLib` |Depends on operating system |Specifies the library directory for the Open Message Queue software.

|`com.sun.aas.configName` |`server-config` |Specifies the name of the configuration used by a server instance.

|`com.sun.aas.instanceName` |`server1` |Specifies the name of the server instance.

|`com.sun.aas.clusterName` |`cluster1` |Specifies the name of the cluster. This property is only set on clustered server instances.

WARNING: This property is not supported for *deployment groups*.

|`com.sun.aas.domainName` |`domain1` |Specifies the name of the domain.

|===

WARNING: The `com.sun.aas.instanceName`, `com.sun.aas.clusterName` and `com.sun.aas.domainName` properties are not used in the default configuration, but can be used to customize configuration.

[[changing-permissions-for-an-application]]
=== Changing Permissions for an Application

The default policy for each domain limits the permissions of Jakarta EE deployed applications to the minimal set of permissions required for these applications to operate correctly.

Do not add extra permissions to the default set (the grant block with no codebase, which applies to all code). Instead, add a new grant block with a codebase specific to the applications requiring the extra permissions, and only add the minimally necessary permissions in that block.

If you develop multiple applications that require more than this default set of permissions, you can add the custom permissions that your applications need. The `com.sun.aas.instanceRoot` variable refers to the domain directory. For example:

[source,java]
----
grant codeBase "file:${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/applications/-" {
...
}
----

You can add permissions to stub code with the following grant block:

[source,java]
----
grant codeBase "file:${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/generated/-" {
...
}
----

In general, you should add extra permissions only to the applications or modules that require them, not to all applications deployed to a domain. To apply permissions for a specific application, for example:

[source,java]
----
grant codeBase "file:${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/applications/MyApp/-" {
...
}
----

And for a specific module:

[source,text]
----
grant codeBase "file:${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/applications/MyModule/-" {
...
}
----

An alternative way to add permissions to a specific application or module is to edit the `granted.policy` file for that application or module. The `granted.policy` file is located in the `${DOMAIN_DIR}/generated/policy/${app-or-module-name}` directory. In this case, you add permissions to the default `grant` block.

CAUTION: Do not delete permissions from this file.

When the Payara Server policy subsystem determines that a permission should not be granted, it logs a `server.policy` message specifying the permission that was not granted and the protection domains, with indicated code source and principals that failed the protection check.

For example, here is a similar entry:

[source,log]
----
[#|INFO|jakarta.enterprise.system.core.security|_ThreadID=14;_ThreadName=Thread-31;|JACC Policy Provider: PolicyWrapper.implies, context(null)-permission((java.util.PropertyPermission java.security.manager write)) domain that failed(ProtectionDomain(file:/glassfish/domains/domain1/applications/sample/ ... )
----

Granting the following permission eliminates the message:

[source,policy]
----
grant codeBase "file:${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/applications/sample/-" {
    permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.security.manager", "write";
}
----

IMPORTANT: Do not add `java.security.AllPermission` to the `server.policy` file for application code. Doing so completely defeats the purpose of the security manager, yet you still get the performance overhead associated with it.

As a last resort, you can iteratively determine the permission set an application needs by observing `AccessControlException` occurrences in the server's log.

If this is not sufficient, you can add the `-Djava.security.debug=failure` JVM option to the domain. Use the following `asadmin create-jvm-options` command, then restart the server:

[source,shell]
----
asadmin create-jvm-options -Djava.security.debug=failure
----

[[enabling-and-disabling-the-security-manager]]
=== Enabling and Disabling the Security Manager

IMPORTANT: The security manager is disabled by default.

In a production environment, you may be able to safely disable the security manager if all the following conditions are true:

* Performance is critical
* Deployment to the production server is carefully controlled
* Only trusted applications are deployed
* Applications don't need a strict policy enforcement

Disabling the security manager may improve performance significantly for some types of applications.

To enable the security manager, do one of the following:

* To use the Administration Console, open the _Security_ component under the relevant configuration, and check the _Security Manager Enabled_ box.
Then restart the server instance.
* Use the following `asadmin create-jvm-options` command, then restart the server:
+
[source,shell]
----
asadmin create-jvm-options -Djava.security.manager
----

To disable the security manager, uncheck the _Security Manager Enabled_ box or use the corresponding `asadmin delete-jvm-options` command.

You must grant additional permissions to CDI-enabled Jakarta EE applications that are deployed in a Payara Server domain, cluster or deployment group for which the security manager is enabled. These additional permissions are not required when it is disabled.

To deploy CDI-enabled Jakarta EE applications in this scenario in which security manager is enabled, add the following permissions to the corresponding applications:

[source,java]
----
grant codeBase "file:${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/applications/[ApplicationName]" {
    permission java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission "suppressAccessChecks";
};
----

For example, for a CDI application named `foo.war`, add the following permissions to the `server.policy` file, restart the domain, cluster or deployment group, and then deploy and use the application.

[source,java]
----
grant codeBase "file:${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/applications/foo" {
    permission java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission "suppressAccessChecks";
}; 
----

[[configuring-message-security-for-web-services]]
== Configuring Message Security for Web Services

In message security, security information is applied at the message layer and travels along with the web services message. Web Services Security (WSS) is the use of XML Encryption and XML Digital Signatures to secure messages.

WSS profiles the use of various security tokens including X.509 certificates, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) assertions, and username/password tokens to achieve this.

Message layer security differs from transport layer security in that it can be used to decouple message protection from message transport so that messages remain protected after transmission, regardless of how many hops they travel.

IMPORTANT: Message layer annotations are not currently supported.

For more information about web services, see xref:docs:application-development-guide:webservices.adoc#developing-web-services[Developing Web Services].

[[message-security-providers]]
=== Message Security Providers

By default, the `XWS_ClientProvider` and `XWS_ServerProvider` security message providers are configured but disabled. You can enable them in one of the following ways:

* To enable the message security providers using the Administration Console, open the _Security_ component under the relevant configuration, select the _Message Security_ component, and select _SOAP_.
Then select `XWS_ServerProvider` from the _Default Provider_ list and `XWS_ClientProvider` from the _Default Client Provider_ list.
* You can enable the message security providers using the following Asadmin CLI commands:
+
[source,shell]
----
asadmin set 
server-config.security-service.message-security-config.SOAP.default_provider=XWS_ServerProvider
asadmin set 
server-config.security-service.message-security-config.SOAP.default_client_provider=XWS_ClientProvider
----

You can create new message security providers in one of the following ways:

* To create a message security provider using the Administration Console, open the _Security_ component under the relevant configuration, and select the _Message Security_ component.
* You can use the `asadmin create-message-security-provider` command to create a message security provider.

In addition, you can set a few optional provider properties using the `asadmin set` command. For example:

[source,shell]
----
asadmin set server-config.security-service.message-security-config.provider-config.property.debug=true
----

The following table describes these message security provider properties.

.Message Security Provider Properties
[cols="2,4,4a",options="header"]
|===

|Property |Default |Description
|`security.config` |`${DOMAIN_DIR}/config/wss-server-config-1.0.xml`
|
Specifies the location of the message security configuration file. To point to a configuration file in the `${DOMAIN_DIR}/config` directory, use the system property like this:

----
${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/config/wss-server-config-1.0.xml
----

|`debug` |`false` |If `true`, enables dumping of server provider debug messages to the server log.

|`dynamic.username.password` |`false` |If `true`, signals the provider runtime to collect the username and password from the `CallbackHandler` for each request.

If `false`, the username and password for `wsse:UsernameToken(s)` is collected once, during module initialization. This property is only applicable for a `ClientAuthModule`.

|`encryption.key.alias` |`s1as` |Specifies the encryption key used by the provider. The key is identified by its `keystore` alias.

|`signature.key.alias` |`s1as` |Specifies the signature key used by the provider. The key is identified by its `keystore` alias.

[[message-security-responsibilities]]
=== Message Security Responsibilities

In Payara Server, the system administrator and application deployer roles are expected to take primary responsibility for configuring message security.

In some situations, the application developer may also contribute, although in the typical case either of the other roles may secure an existing application without changing its implementation and without involving the developer.

[[application-developer-responsibilities]]
==== Application Developer Responsibilities

The application developer can turn on message security, but is not responsible for doing so. Message security can be set up by the system administrator so that all web services are secured, or set up by the application deployer when the provider or protection policy bound to the application must be different from that bound to the container.

The application developer is responsible for the following:

* Determining if an application-specific message protection policy is required by the application. If so, ensuring that the required policy is specified at application assembly which may be accomplished by communicating with the application deployer.
* Determining if message security is necessary at the server's level. If so, ensuring that this need is communicated to the system administrator, or taking care of implementing message security at the server's level.

[[application-deployer-responsibilities]]
==== Application Deployer Responsibilities

The application deployer is responsible for the following:

* Specifying (at application assembly) any required application-specific message protection policies if such policies have not already been specified by upstream roles (the developer or assembler).
* Modifying Payara Server deployment descriptors to specify application-specific message protection policies information (message-security-binding elements) to web service endpoint and service references

These security tasks are discussed in xref:securing-apps.adoc#application-specific-message-protection[Application-Specific Message Protection].

[[system-administrator-responsibilities]]
==== System Administrator Responsibilities

The system administrator is responsible for the following:

* Configuring message security providers on Payara Server.
* Managing user databases.
* Managing keystore and truststore files.

A system administrator uses the Administration Console to manage server security settings and uses a command line tool to manage certificate databases. Certificates and private keys are stored in key stores and are managed with the `keytool` utility (and in the case of Payara Server Enterprise with its Integrated Certificate Management enhancements).

[[application-specific-message-protection]]
=== Application-Specific Message Protection

When the Payara Server provided configuration is insufficient for your security needs, and you want to override the default protection, you can apply application-specific message security to a web service.

Application-specific security is implemented by adding the message security binding to the web service endpoint, whether it is an EJB or servlet web service endpoint. Modify the corresponding XML deployment descriptor files to add the message binding information.

Message security can also be specified using a WSIT security policy in the WSDL file.

For more information about message security providers, see xref:securing-apps.adoc#message-security-providers[Message Security Providers].

For more details on message security binding for EJB web services,servlet web services, and clients, see the XML file descriptions in "xref:docs:application-deployment-guide:dd-elements.adoc#elements-of-the-payara-server-deployment-descriptors[Elements of the Payara Server Deployment Descriptors]" in the Payara Server Application Deployment Guide.

[[programmatic-login-using-the-programmaticlogin-class]]
== Programmatic Login Using the ProgrammaticLogin Class

Programmatic login allows a deployed Jakarta EE application or module to invoke a *login* method. If the login is successful, a `SecurityContext` is established as if the client had authenticated using any of the conventional Jakarta EE mechanisms.

Programmatic login is supported for servlet and EJB components on the server side, and for stand-alone or application clients on the client side.

Programmatic login is useful for an application having special needs that cannot be accommodated by any of the Jakarta EE standard authentication mechanisms.

This section describes a proprietary Payara mechanism, but see also the standard security APIs in the Jakarta EE tutorial.

NOTE: The `com.sun.enterprise.security.ee.auth.login.ProgrammaticLogin` class present in Payara Server is not part of any Jakarta EE APIs; therefore, it is not portable to other application servers.

[[programmatic-login-precautions]]
=== Programmatic Login Precautions

Payara Server is not involved in how the login information (`user`, `password`) is obtained by the deployed application. Programmatic login places the burden on the application developer with respect to assuring that the resulting system meets security requirements. If the application code reads the authentication information across the network, the application determines whether to trust the user.

Programmatic login allows the application developer to bypass the Payara Server-supported authentication mechanisms and feed authentication data directly to the security service.

CAUTION: While flexible, this capability should not be used without some understanding of security issues. +
Since this mechanism bypasses the container-managed authentication process and sequence, the application developer must be very careful in making sure that authentication is established before accessing any restricted resources or methods.

It is also the application developer's responsibility to verify the status of the login attempt and to alter the behavior of the application accordingly.

The programmatic login state does not necessarily persist in sessions or participate in single sign-on.

Lazy authentication is not supported for programmatic login. If an access check is reached and the deployed application has not properly authenticated using the programmatic login method, access is denied immediately and the application might fail if not coded to account for this occurrence.

One way to account for this occurrence is to catch the access control or security exception, perform a programmatic login, and repeat the request.

[[granting-programmatic-login-permission]]
=== Granting Programmatic Login Permission

The `ProgrammaticLoginPermission` permission is required to invoke the programmatic login mechanism for an application if the security manager is enabled. For information about the security manager, see xref:securing-apps.adoc#the-server.policy-file[The `server.policy` File].

This permission is not granted by default to deployed applications because this is not a standard Jakarta EE mechanism.

To grant the required permission to the application, add the following to the `${DOMAIN_DIR}/config/server.policy` file:

[source,java]
----
grant codeBase "file:${jar-file-path}" {
    permission com.sun.appserv.security.ProgrammaticLoginPermission "login";
};
----

NOTE: `jar-file-path` is the path to the application's JAR file.

[[the-programmaticlogin-class]]
=== The `ProgrammaticLogin` Class

The `com.sun.enterprise.security.ee.auth.login.ProgrammaticLogin` class enables a user to perform login programmatically and in addition, logout of the existing security context when required.

The `ProgrammaticLogin` class has eight overloaded `login` methods: four variants to be used by Web components and four variants to be used by EJB components.

The login methods for web components have the following signatures:

[source, java]
----
public Boolean login(String user, String password, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)

//Same as above, but uses a char[] for the password credential
public Boolean login(String user, char[] password, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)

public Boolean login(String user, String password, String realm, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, boolean errors) throws Exception

//Same as above, but uses a char[] for the password credential
public Boolean login(String user, char[] password, String realm, HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, boolean errors) throws Exception
----

The login methods for EJB components have the following signatures:

[source,java]
----
public Boolean login(String user, String password)

//Same as above, but uses a char[] for the password credential
public Boolean login(String user, char[] password)

public Boolean login(String user, String password, String realm, boolean errors) throws Exception

//Same as above, but uses a char[] for the password credential
public Boolean login(String user, char[] password, String realm, boolean errors)
----

All method variants accomplish the following:

* Perform the authentication
* Return `true` if login succeeded, `false` if the login has failed

The login occurs on the realm specified unless it is `null`, in which case the domain's default realm is used. The variants with no `realm` parameter will use the domain's default security realm.

If the `errors` parameter is set to `true`, any exceptions encountered during the login process are propagated to the caller. If set to `false`, exceptions will be thrown.

WARNING: On the client side, the `realm` and `errors` parameters are ignored and the actual login does not occur until a resource requiring a login is accessed. A `java.rmi.AccessException` with a `COBRA NO_PERMISSION` occurs if the actual login fails.

The `logout` method has 4 overloaded variants: 2 used by Web components,  2 used by EJB components. Here are the variants used by web components:

[source,java]
----
public Boolean logout(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)

public Boolean logout(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, boolean errors) throws Exception
----

The variants used for EJB components have the following signatures:

[source,java]
----
public Boolean logout()

public Boolean logout(boolean errors) throws Exception
----

All `logout` method variants return `true` if the logout process succeeded, `false` if it failed.

If the `errors` parameter is set to `true`, any exceptions encountered during the logout process are propagated to the caller. If set to `false`, exceptions will be thrown.

[[user-authentication-for-single-sign-on]]
== User Authentication for Single Sign-on

The single sign-on feature of the Payara Server allows multiple web applications deployed to the same virtual server to share the user authentication state.

With single sign-on enabled, users who log in to one web application become *implicitly logged* into other web applications on the same virtual server that require the same authentication information. Otherwise, users would have to log in separately to each web application whose protected resources they tried to access.

A sample application using the single sign-on scenario could be a consolidated airline booking service that searches all airlines and provides links to different airline websites. After the user signs on to the consolidated booking service, the user information can be used by each individual airline site without requiring another sign-on.

Single sign-on operates according to the following rules:

* Single sign-on applies to web applications configured for the same security realm and virtual server. The realm is defined by the `realm-name` element in the `web.xml` file. For information about virtual servers, see "xref:docs:administration-guide:http_https.adoc#administering-internet-connectivity[Administering Internet Connectivity]" in the Payara Server Administration Guide.

* As long as users access only unprotected resources in any of the web applications on a virtual server, they are not challenged to authenticate themselves.

* As soon as a user accesses a protected resource in any web application associated with a virtual server, the user is challenged to authenticate himself or herself, using the login method defined for the web application currently being accessed.

* After authentication, the roles associated with this user are used for access control decisions across all associated web applications, without challenging the user to authenticate to each application individually.

* When the user logs out of one web application (for example, by invalidating the corresponding web session), the user's sessions in all web applications are automatically invalidated. Any subsequent attempt to access a protected resource in any application requires the user to authenticate again.

IMPORTANT: The single sign-on feature utilizes HTTP cookies to transmit a token that associates each request with the saved user identity, so it can only be used in client environments that support cookies.

To configure single sign-on, set the following configuration properties for a *virtual server*:

`sso-enabled`:: If `false`, single sign-on is disabled for this virtual server, and users must authenticate separately to every application on the virtual server. The default value is `false`.

`sso-max-inactive-seconds`:: Specifies the time after which a user's single sign-on record becomes eligible for purging if no client activity is received. Since single sign-on applies across several applications on the same virtual server, access to any of the applications keeps the single sign-on record active. The default value is _5 minutes_ (`300` seconds).
+
CAUTION: Higher values provide longer single sign-on persistence for the users at the expense of more memory use on the server.

`sso-reap-interval-seconds`:: Specifies the interval between purges of expired single sign-on records. The default value is `60`.

Here are example `asadmin set` commands on a virtual server named `vsrv1` using the default values mentioned above:

[source,shell]
----
asadmin set server-config.http-service.virtual-server.vsrv1.property.sso-enabled="true"
asadmin set server-config.http-service.virtual-server.vsrv1.property.sso-max-inactive-seconds="300"
asadmin set server-config.http-service.virtual-server.vsrv1.property.sso-reap-interval-seconds="60"
----

[[jakarta-security-support]]
== Jakarta Security Support

Jakarta Security defines several authentication-related plugin SPIs, such as the `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` and `IdentityStore` interfaces:

`HttpAuthenticationMechanism`:: An interface for modules that authenticate callers to a web application. An application can supply its own `HttpAuthenticationMechanism`, or use one of the default implementations provided by the container.
`IdentityStore`:: This interface defines methods for validating a caller's credentials (such as username and password) and returning group membership information. An application can provide its own `IdentityStore`, or use the builtin LDAP or Database stores.

In addition to these authentication plugin SPIs, the Jakarta Security specification defines the `SecurityContext` API for use by application code to query and interact with the current security context.

The `SecurityContext` interface defines methods that allow an application to access security information about a caller, authenticate a caller, and authorize a caller. These methods include `getCallerPrincipal()`, `getPrincipalsByType()`, `isCallerInRole()`, `authenticate()`, and `hasAccessToWebResource()`.

[[payara-and-jakarta-security]]
=== Payara Platform and Jakarta Security

Payara Server and Micro implement Jakarta Security to provide built-in support for the following authentication mechanisms:

* BASIC
* FORM
* Custom FORM
* OpenID Connect

A significant advantage of using `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` and `IdentityStore` over the declarative mechanisms defined by the Servlet specification is that it allows an application to control the identity stores that it authenticates against, in a standard, portable way. You can use the built-in implementations of these APIs, or define custom implementations as suggested by the specification.

Jakarta Security  defines several annotations, with names that end with the `Definition` suffix, which when used makes the corresponding built-in mechanism available as a CDI bean.

TIP: Jakarta Security also supports the use of Jakarta Expression Language in these annotations to allow dynamic configuration.

[[built-in-authentication-mechanisms-and-identity-stores]]
==== Built-in Authentication Mechanisms and Identity Stores

An application packages its own `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` by including in a bean archive that is a part of the application. Alternatively, it may select and configure one of the built-in mechanisms using the corresponding annotation, as listed below:

`BasicAuthenticationMechanismDefinition` :: Implements HTTP BASIC authentication that conforms to the behavior of the servlet container when BASIC <auth-method> is declared in the `web.xml` deployment descriptor.
`FormAuthenticationMechanismDefinition`:: Implements HTTP FORM authentication that conforms to the behavior of the servlet container when the FORM <auth-method> is declared in the `web.xml` deployment descriptor.
`CustomFormAuthenticationMechanismDefinition`:: Implements a modified version of HTTP FORM authentication in which custom handling replaces the POST action to the `j_security_check` servlet.
`OpenIdAuthenticationMechanismDefinition`:: Implements an OpenID Connect authentication workflow using the metadata configured in the annotation attributes.

All built-in authentication mechanisms need to be authenticated using an identity store. The `IdentityStore` interface, included in the Jakarta Security API, defines an SPI for interacting with identity stores, which are repositories (like databases or naming directories) containing user account information.

The `IdentityStore` interface has four methods: `validate(Credential)`, `getCallerGroups(CredentialValidationResult)`, `validationTypes()` and `priority()`. Developers can provide their own implementation of this interface, or use one of the built-in identity stores.

TIP: The `RememberMeIdentityStore` interface, which is a variation on the `IdentityStore` interface, can be used when an application wants to "remember" a user's authenticated session for an extended period, so that the caller can return to the application periodically without needing to present primary authentication credentials each time.

There are two built-in implementations of `IdentityStore`:

`LdapIdentityStoreDefinition`:: Used to configure an LDAP naming directory as the identity store of an application.
`DatabaseIdentityStoreDefinition`:: Used to configure a set of relational database tables as the identity store.

The following snippet shows the usage of the `DatabaseIdentityStoreDefinition` annotation, which makes it available as a CDI bean.

[source, java]
----
@DatabaseIdentityStoreDefinition(
    callerQuery = "#{'select password from caller where name = ?'}",
    groupsQuery = "select group_name from caller_groups where caller_name = ?",
    hashAlgorithm = Pbkdf2PasswordHash.class,
    priorityExpression = "#{100}",
    hashAlgorithmParameters = {
        "Pbkdf2PasswordHash.Iterations=3072",
        "${applicationConfig.dynamic}"
    }
)
----

Since the Jakarta Security API provides support for Jakarta Expression Language, regular expressions can be used to set value of annotation attributes.

Payara Server provides out of the box implementation of the `Pbkdf2PasswordHash` interface that supports PBKDF2 password hashing.

It is suggested that you use `Pbkdf2PasswordHash` for generating and validating passwords, unless there are specific requirements which cannot be met in any other way.

[[custom-authentication-mechanism]]
==== Custom Authentication Mechanism

An application provider can choose to provide its own custom authentication mechanism, apart from built-in authentication mechanisms.

A custom authentication mechanism implements the `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` interface, introduced in Jakarta Security. This interface defines the following three methods.

[source,java]
----
AuthenticationStatus validateRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, HttpMessageContext httpMessageContext) throws AuthenticationException;

AuthenticationStatus secureResponse(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, HttpMessageContext httpMessageContext) throws AuthenticationException;

void cleanSubject(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, HttpMessageContext httpMessageContext);
----

A custom authentication mechanism must return an `AuthenticationStatus` to indicate the status of its current authentication request. Internally, it gets translated to a corresponding Jakarta Authentication `AuthStatus` instance as shown below:

* `AuthenticationStatus.NOT_DONE` -> `AuthStatus.SUCCESS`
* `AuthenticationStatus.SEND_CONTINUE` -> `AuthStatus.SEND_CONTINUE`
* `AuthenticationStatus.SUCCESS` -> `AuthStatus.SUCCESS`
* `AuthenticationStatus.SEND_FAILURE` -> `AuthStatus.SEND_FAILURE`

Each method of the `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` interface performs the same function as the corresponding `ServerAuth` methods.

Unlike Jakarta Authentication, `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` is specified for the servlet container only. Only the `validateRequest()` must be implemented, for other two methods, default behaviors are specified.

`validateRequest` allows a caller to authenticate. The request gets inspected inside `validateRequest` to read credential or any other information, or it can write to standard response with status of the authentication request or redirect the caller to an OAuth provider. Once the credential is validated, the result of the validation is communicated to the container using the `HttpMessageContext` parameter.

Here's an example of a custom authentication mechanism:

NOTE: Only the `validateRequest` method has been implemented, since Jakarta Security provides default implementation of the other two methods. An application provider may choose to override the default implementation depending on the business context.

[source,java]

        // Get the (caller) name and password from the request
        // NOTE: This is for the smallest possible example only. In practice
        // putting the password in a request query parameter is highly
        // insecure and is discouraged.
        var name = request.getParameter("name");
        var password = request.getParameter("password");

        if (name != null && password != null) {
            // Delegate the {credentials in -> identity data out} function to the Identity Store
            var result = identityStoreHandler.validate(new UsernamePasswordCredential(name, password));

            if (result.getStatus() == VALID) {
                // Communicate the details of the authenticated user to the container.
                response.addHeader("Authentication Mechanism", "MyAuthenticationMechanism");
                return httpMessageContext.notifyContainerAboutLogin(result.getCallerPrincipal(), result.getCallerGroups());
            } else {
                return httpMessageContext.responseUnauthorized();
            }
        }
        return httpMessageContext.doNothing();
    }
}

[[jakarta-authentication-support]]
== Jakarta Authentication Support

Jakarta Authentication is part of the Jakarta EE specification and defined by https://jakarta.ee/specifications/authentication[its own specification].

Jakarta Authentication defines an interface for pluggable authorization providers. Specifically, it is used to plug in the Java policy provider used by the container to perform Jakarta EE caller access decisions. The Java policy provider performs Java policy decisions during application execution.

This provides third parties with a mechanism to develop and plug in modules that are responsible for answering authorization decisions during a Jakarta EE application execution. The interfaces and rules used for developing authentication providers are defined in the specification document.

Payara Server provides a simple file-based Jakarta Authentication engine as a default *JACC provider* (JACC stands for the previous name of the specification before its transition to Jakarta EE), named `default`. An alternate provider named `simple` is also provided.

To configure an alternate provider using the Administration Console, open the _Security_ component under the relevant configuration, and select the _JACC Providers_ component.

[[payara-server-and-jakarta-authentication]]
=== Payara Server and Jakarta Authentication

The Jakarta Authentication specification defines profiles that establish contracts for the use of the SPI in specific contexts.

Jakarta Authentication's Servlet Container Profile defines the use of the SPI by a Servlet container such that:

* The resulting container can be configured with new authentication mechanisms.
* The container employs the configured mechanisms in its enforcement of the declarative servlet security model (declared in a `web.xml` deployment descriptor file using `security-constraint` elements or by specific annotations in the servlet implementation classes).

Jakarta Authentication defines a simple message processing model composed of four interaction points when processing an authentication request:

. `secureRequest` on the client
. `validateRequest` on the server
. `secureResponse` on the server
. `validateResponse` on the client

A message processing runtime uses the SPI at these interaction points to delegate the corresponding message security processing to authentication providers, also called authentication modules, integrated into the runtime by way of the SPI.

A compatible server-side message processing runtime, such as the Payara Server servlet container, supports the `validateRequest` and `secureResponse` interaction points of the message processing model.

The servlet container uses the SPI at these interaction points to delegate the corresponding message security processing to a *server authentication module (SAM)*, integrated by the SPI into the container.

You can use Jakarta Authentication in the web tier to facilitate the injection of pluggable authentication modules within the servlet constraint processing engine. Payara Server includes implementations of a number of HTTP layer authentication mechanisms such as `basic`, `form`, and `digest` authentication.

You can add alternative implementations of the included mechanisms or implementations of new mechanisms such as Kerberos/SPNEGO or CAS for example.

=== Writing a Server Authentication Module

A key step in adding an authentication mechanism to a compatible server-side message processing runtime such as the servlet container is acquiring a SAM that implements the desired authentication mechanism. One way to do that is to write the SAM yourself.

A SAM implements the `jakarta.security.auth.message.module.ServerAuthModule` interface as defined by the specification. A SAM is invoked indirectly by the message processing runtime at the `validateRequest` and `secureResponse` interaction points. A SAM must implement the five methods of the `ServerAuthModule` interface:

`getSupportedMessageTypes`:: Returns an array of `Class` objects where each element defines a message type supported by the SAM.
+
NOTE: For a SAM to be compatible with the Servlet Container Profile, the returned array must include the `HttpServletRequest.class` and `HttpServletResponse.class` objects.

`initialize(MessagePolicy requestPolicy, MessagePolicy responsePolicy, CallbackHandler cbh, Map options)`:: The container calls this method to provide the SAM with configuration values and with a `CallbackHandler`.
+
The configuration values are returned in the policy arguments and in the options `Map`. The SAM uses `CallbackHandler` to access services, such as password validation, provided by the container.

`AuthStatus validateRequest(MessageInfo messageInfo, Subject clientSubject, Subject serviceSubject)`:: The container calls this method to process each `HttpServletRequest` received. The request and its associated `HttpServletResponse` are passed by the container to the SAM in the `messageInfo` argument. The SAM processes the request and may establish  the response to be returned by the container.
+
The SAM uses the provided `Subject` arguments to convey its authentication results. The SAM returns different status values to control the container's invocation processing. The status values and the circumstances under which they are returned are as follows:

* `AuthStatus.SUCCESS` is returned when the application request message is successfully validated. The container responds to this status value by using the returned client `Subject` to invoke the target of the request. When this value is returned, the SAM (provided a custom `AuthConfigProvider` is not being used) must use its `CallbackHandler` to handle a `CallerPrincipalCallback` using the `clientSubject` as an argument to the callback.

* `AuthStatus.SEND_CONTINUE` indicates that message validation is incomplete and that the SAM has established a preliminary response as the response message in `messageInfo`. The container responds to this status value by sending the response to the client.

* `AuthStatus.SEND_FAILURE` indicates that message validation failed  and that the SAM has established an appropriate failure response message in `messageInfo`. The container responds to this status value by sending the response to the client.

* `AuthStatus.SEND_SUCCESS` is not typically returned. This status value indicates the end of a multi-message security dialog originating after the service interaction and during the processing of the application response. The container responds to this status value by sending the response to the client.
+
The `validateRequest` method may also throw an `AuthException` to indicate that the message processing by the SAM failed without establishing a failure response message in `messageInfo`.

`secureResponse(MessageInfo messageInfo, Subject serviceSubject)`:: The container calls this method before sending a response, resulting from an application invocation, to the client. The response is passed to the SAM in the `messageInfo` argument. In most cases, this method should just return the `SEND_SUCCESS` status.

`cleanSubject(MessageInfo messageInfo, Subject subject)`:: This method removes the mechanism-specific principals, credentials, or both from the subject. This method is not currently called by the container. A legitimate implementation could remove all the principals from the argument subject.

=== Sample Server Authentication Module

The class `MySam.java` is a sample SAM implementation. Notice that the sample implements the five methods of the ServerAuthModule interface. This SAM implements an emulation of HTTP basic authentication for demonstration purposes.

NOTE: The `initialize` method looks for the `group.name` and `realm.name` properties. The `group.name` property configures the default group assigned as a result of any successful authentication. +
The `realm.name` property defines the realm value sent back to the browser in the `WWW-Authenticate` challenge.

[[compiling-and-installing-a-server-authentication-module]]
=== Compiling and Installing a Server Authentication Module

Before you can use the sample SAM, you need to compile, install, and configure it. Then you can bind it to an application.

To compile the SAM, include the SPI in your classpath. After you compile the SAM, install it by copying a JAR file containing the compiled SAM to the `${PAYARA_INSTALL}/glassfish/lib` directory.

[[configuring-a-server-authentication-module]]
=== Configuring a Server Authentication Module

You can configure a SAM in one of these ways:

* In the Administration Console, open the _Security_ component under the relevant configuration and go to the _Message Security_ page. Set the following options:

** *Authentication Layer*: `HttpServlet`
** *Provider Type*: `server` or `client-server`
** *Provider ID*: Specify a unique name for the SAM, for example `MySAM`
** *Class Name*: Specify the fully qualified class name, for example `fish.payara.samples.security.MySam`
** *Additional Property*:
*** Name: `group-name`
*** Value: `user`
** *Additional Property*:
*** Name: `realm-name`
*** Value: `Sam`


* Use the `asadmin create-message-security-provider` command to configure a SAM. Set the following options:

** `--layer HttpServlet`
** `--providertype server` or `--providertype client-server`
** `--classname fish.payara.samples.security.MySam`
** `--property group-name=user:realm-name=Sam`
** Provider name operand — Specify a unique name for the SAM, for example `MySAM`

[[binding-a-server-authentication-module-to-your-application]]
=== Binding a Server Authentication Module to Your Application

After you install and configure the SAM, you can bind it for use by the container on behalf of one or more of your applications. You have two options in how you bind the SAM, depending on whether you are willing to repackage and redeploy your application:

* If you are willing to repackage and redeploy, you can bind the SAM using the `glassfish-web.xml` or `payara-web.xml` deployment descriptor file. Set the value of the `httpservlet-security-provider` attribute of the `glassfish-web-app`/`payara-web-app` element to the SAM's configured provider ID, for example, `MySAM`. This option leverages the native `AuthConfigProvider` implementation that ships with Payara Server.

* Another approach is to develop your own `AuthConfigProvider` and register it with the server's `AuthConfigFactory` for use on behalf of your applications. For example, a simple `AuthConfigProvider` can obtain, through its initialization properties, the classname of a SAM to configure on behalf of the applications for which the provider is registered.

TIP: You can find a description of the functionality of an `AuthConfigProvider` and of the registration facilities provided by an `AuthConfigFactory` in the Jakarta Authentication specification.

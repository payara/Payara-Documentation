= Developing SOAP Web Services

This chapter describes Payara Server's support for SOAP-compatible web services. "https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-tutorial/#building-web-services-with-jakarta-xml-web-services[Building with Jakarta XML Web Services]" in The Jakarta EE Tutorial shows more details on creating dedicated SOAP Web Services for any Jakarta EE runtime.

For additional information about JAXB (Jakarta XML Binding), see https://jakarta.ee/specifications/xml-binding/[its corresponding specification] and xref:webservices.adoc#the-databinding-provider[The Databinding Provider].

For additional information about Jakarta XML Web Services,
see https://jakarta.ee/specifications/xml-web-services/[its corresponding specification].

For information about web services security, see xref:docs:application-development-guide:securing-apps.adoc#configuring-message-security-for-web-services[Configuring Message Security for Web Services].

The Fast Infoset standard specifies a binary format based on the XML Information Set. This format is an efficient alternative to XML. For more information about using Fast Infoset, see the following links:

[[deploying-a-web-service]]
== Deploying a Web Service

You deploy a web service endpoint to Payara Server just as you would any servlet, stateless session bean (SLSB), or application.

IMPORTANT: For complex services with dependent classes, user specified WSDL files, or other advanced features, auto-deployment of an annotated file is not sufficient.

The Payara Server deployment descriptor files `glassfish-web.xml`/`payara-web.xml` and `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml` provide optional web service enhancements in the `webservice-endpoint` and `webservice-description` elements, including a `debugging-enabled` sub-element that enables the creation of a test page.

The test page feature is enabled by default and described in xref:webservices.adoc#the-web-service-uri-wsdl-file-and-test-page[The Web Service URI, WSDL File, and Test Page].

[[the-web-service-uri-wsdl-file-and-test-page]]
== The Web Service URI, WSDL File, and Test Page

Clients can run a deployed web service by accessing its service endpoint address URI, which has the following format:

[source,text]
----
http://${host}:${port}/${context-root}/${servlet-mapping-url-pattern}
----

The context-root is defined in the `application.xml` or `web.xml` file, and can be overridden in the `glassfish-application.xml` or
`glassfish-web.xml`/`payara-web.xml` file. The servlet-mapping-url-pattern is defined in the `web.xml` file.

In the following example, the context-root is `my-ws` and the servlet-mapping-url-pattern is `/simple` for local deployment in the default port:

[source,text]
----
http://localhost:8080/my-ws/simple
----

You can view the WSDL file of the deployed service in a browser by adding `?WSDL` to the end of the URI. For example:

[source,text]
----
http://localhost:8080/my-ws/simple?WSDL
----

For debugging, you can run a test page for the deployed service in a browser by adding `?Tester` to the end of the URL. For example:

[source,text]
----
http://localhost:8080/my-ws/simple?Tester
----

This URL will show the SOAP Web Service Tester in the corresponding browser allowing users to quickly test their web services after deployment.

You can also test a service using the Administration Console. Open the _Web Services_ component for the corresponding deployed application, select the web service in the listing on the _General_ tab, and select _Test_.

WARNING: The tester webpage works only for WS-I compliant web services. This means that the tester servlet does not work for services with WSDL files that use RPC/encoded binding.

The Web Service tester application is enabled by default. You can disable the test page for a web service by setting the value of the
`debugging-enabled` element in the `glassfish-web.xml`/`payara-web.xml` and `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml` deployment descriptor to `false`.

[[the-databinding-provider]]
== The Databinding Provider

To specify the Jakarta XML Binding provider implementation for the server runtime, set the `com.sun.xml.ws.spi.db.BindingContextFactory` JVM property to one of the following values:

* `com.sun.xml.ws.db.glassfish.JAXBRIContextFactory`: Specifies the JAXB reference implementation in Payara Server (bundled within Metro). This is the default setting.
* `org.eclipse.persistence.jaxb.JAXBContextFactory`: Specifies Eclipselink MOXy Jakarta XML bindings.
+
For example:
+
[source,shell]
----
asadmin create-jvm-options -Dcom.sun.xml.ws.spi.db.BindingContextFactory=org.eclipse.persistence.jaxb.JAXBContextFactory
----

To specify the Jakarta XML Binding provider for a *specific* web service endpoint, you have the following options:

* Set the `com.oracle.webservices.api.databinding.DatabindingModeFeature` feature during `WebServiceFeature` initialization or using the `add` method.
+
Allowed values are as follows:
+
** `com.oracle.webservices.api.databinding.DatabindingModeFeature.GLASSFISH_JAXB`: Specifies the JAXB reference implementation (bundled within Metro). This is the default setting.
** `org.eclipse.persistence.jaxb.JAXBContextFactory.ECLIPSELINK_JAXB`: Specifies Eclipselink MOXy JAXB binding.
+
For example:
+
[source,java]
----
import jakarta.xml.ws.WebServiceFeature;
import com.oracle.webservices.api.databinding.DatabindingModeFeature;
import org.eclipse.persistence.jaxb.JAXBContextFactory;

WebServiceFeature[] features = {new DatabindingModeFeature(JAXBContextFactory.ECLIPSELINK_JAXB)};

----

* Set the `com.oracle.webservices.api.databinding.DatabindingModeFeature` feature using the `@DatabindingMode` annotation. For example:
+
[source,java]
----
import jakarta.jws.WebService;
import com.oracle.webservices.api.databinding.DatabindingMode;
import org.eclipse.persistence.jaxb.JAXBContextFactory;

@WebService
@DatabindingMode(JAXBContextFactory.ECLIPSELINK_JAXB)
public class MyWebService{
}
----

IMPORTANT: To configure these features in your application at compile time you'll have to configure explicit dependencies to the Eclipse EE4J Metro and EclipseLink's projects.

This section details how to use the underlying Data Grid Hazelcast instance in Payara Server within application code.

[[accessing-the-jndi-registered-hazelcast-instance]]
== Accessing the Hazelcast instance via JNDI

By default, the JNDI name of the hazelcast instance is `payara/Hazelcast`, though this can be altered using the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/set-hazelcast-configuration.adoc[set-hazelcast-configuration] command. You will need to import the following packages into your Java class:

[source, java]
----
import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance;
import javax.naming.Context;
import javax.naming.InitialContext;
----

To import the requisite Hazelcast classes, you will need to set add the Public API artefact as a dependency in the project's `pom.xml` file (in case of Maven projects), or have the Hazelcast JAR set as a project dependency (if using a non-Maven based project).

Here's the Maven dependency:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>fish.payara.api</groupId>
  <artifactId>payara-api</artifactId>
  <version>${page-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

The Hazelcast JAR (for non-Maven projects), can either be downloaded from the http://hazelcast.org/download/[Hazelcast website], or you can make use of the JAR that is packaged in Payara Server. The JAR packaged with Payara can be found at `<Payara Installation Directory>/glassfish/modules/hazelcast.jar`.

The following code sample will initialize a `HazelcastInstance` variable in the instance embedded in Payara:

[source, java]
----
public class Component{

    public void businessMethod(){
        var ctx = new InitialContext();
        HazelcastInstance instance = (HazelcastInstance) ctx.lookup("payara/Hazelcast");
    }
}
----

WARNING: It is recommended to wrap this block in a `try-catch` clause, since a `NamingException` exception can be generated due to the use of JNDI.

. Then click *Next* again to window with the configuration of the domain. In this example we use domain without configured admin user and the server is not started in debug mode.

. In the last step you can select resources which will be deployed on the server. Here we don't have any deployable projects in the workspace yet, so both panels are empty.

== Adding Resources to Server

. First import or create some project, deployable to the *Payara Server*. Here we use one of the https://github.com/javaee-samples/javaee7-samples[Java EE 7 Samples] .

. Right click the target server in the *Servers* view and click *Add and Remove...*

. Now you can watch the deployment of the application in the *Console* view.
+

. If the deployment was successful, you can use the application. Here we simply opened the internal Eclipse's browser and sent the HTTP GET request - and the application responded.

. You can also access the administration console directly from the Eclipse Browser. Just right click the target server in the *Servers* view and click *Payara -> View Admin Console*

WARNING: Changing the runtime may result in unusable state of the server because of incompatible configuration.

[[deployment-settings]]
== Deployment Settings

The Auto Deploy and Hot Deploy mode are helpful for developers to run and test an application immediately after making changes to its sources without restarting the Server or manual redeployment to maximize your productivity.

[[hot-deploy]]
=== Hot Deploy

Payara Server provides the Hot Deployment capability, which boosts the performance of the application redeployment operation and dynamically replaces the classloader of the application on each redeployment in the hot deploy mode.

The Hot Deploy mode can be enabled in Visual Studio Code from the *Deployment Settings* of Payara Server.

NOTE: The Hot Deploy feature is in technical preview.

After enabling the Hot Deploy settings as mentioned above, simply deploy web applications to Payara Server  and modify any Java class of the application to perform the auto redeploy of application on save. You'll observe that redeployment of the application in Payara Server is faster than vanilla redeployment and console log will confirm that the hot redeployment happened.

[[auto-deploy]]
=== Auto Deploy
By enabling the Auto Deploy feature, you may automate the manual deployment processes to boost the developers productivity. It will un-deploy the existing application and redeploy the new application on every save action so developers can focus on the key development task. Auto Deploy feature full redeploys an application and therefore is slower than hot redeploy, which redeploys only the changed part of an application.

An application can be deployed and undeployed easily from within NetBeans. First, the application run settings need to be configured to use Payara Server. Go to Properties on a project and then the Run section of this window. This menu lists the configuration for deploying the application.

Select the Payara Server you have configured. You can also select a context path for the application to be deployed to, as well as NetBeans behaviour when deploying.

Deploying to Payara Server now only requires running the application like any other NetBeans project. Once it’s deployed, the Services view will then display the application under Payara Server, where you can undeploy, enable, disable and view the application in the browser.

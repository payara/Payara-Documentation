. Click *Add Server*.
. Select *Payara Server* and choose a name for the server.
. Select the location of the `payara` directory of your Payara Server installation. If the DAS is on another machine then check the *Remote Domain* box, otherwise select *Local Domain*. Read and accept the license agreement.

* Domain -> This is the name of the domain you want to use. By default this is `*domain1*`.
* Host -> This is the hostname that the server will be listening on. By default this is `*localhost*`.
* DAS Port -> This is the port that the `*admin-listener*` listens on. By default this is `*4848*`.
* HTTP Port -> This is the port that the application will be hosted on. By default this is `*8080*`.
* Target -> This is the name of the node that the application will be getting deployed to. This can be left blank if it is a local installation.

== Managing Payara Server from NetBeans

Management of Payara Server from NetBeans is done through the *Services* tab.

Once Payara Server is added to NetBeans it can be found under *Servers* with the configured name. Right clicking on the server lets you do the following actions:

* Start or stop the server.
* Start debugging the server.
* Open admin console.
* Open server log.

Exploding the server dropdown will list *Applications*, *Resources* and *Web Services*. This allows you to view and manage certain Payara Server configurations, from the NetBeans interface.

*Example:* Under `Resources -> JDBC -> Connection Pools -> H2Pool (right click) -> Properties` you can view and modify connection pool properties for the H2Pool.

== Deploying Applications to Payara Server

An application can be deployed and undeployed easily from within NetBeans. First, the application run settings need to be configured to use Payara Server. Go to *Properties* on a project and then the *Run* section of this window. This menu lists the configuration for deploying the application.

Select the Payara Server you have configured. You can also select a context path for the application to be deployed to, as well as NetBeans behaviour when deploying.

Deploying to Payara Server now only requires running the application like any other NetBeans project. Once it's deployed, the *Services* view will then display the application under *Payara Server*, where you can undeploy, enable, disable and view the application in the browser.

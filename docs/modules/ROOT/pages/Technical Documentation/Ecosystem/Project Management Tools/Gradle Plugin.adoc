== Plugin Tasks

[[bundle]]
=== `microBundle`

*Aim*: This task bundles the attached project's artifact into an Uber JAR with the specified configurations.
*Usage*: `gradle microBundle`

.Configuration tags
[cols="2,1,7",options="header"]
|===
|Element
|Default
|Notes

|`javaPath`
|java
|Absolute path to the java executable

|`payaraVersion`
|{currentVersion}
|By default `microBundle` task fetches payara-micro with version {currentVersion}
|=== 

[[start]]
=== `microStart`

*Aim*: This task starts Payara Micro with the specified configuration.
*Usage*: `gradle microStart`

.Configuration tags
[cols="2,1,7",options="header"]
|===
|Element
|Default
|Notes

|`useUberJar`
|false
|Use created uber-jar that resides in target folder. The name of the JAR artifact will be resolved automatically by evaluating its final name, artifact ID and version. This configuration element has the higher precedence compared to `payaraMicroAbsolutePath` and `payaraVersion`.

|`payaraMicroAbsolutePath`
|_none_
|Absolute path to payara-micro executable.

|`payaraVersion`
|{currentVersion}
|By default `microStart` task fetches Payara Micro with version {currentVersion}.

|`daemon`
|false
|Starts Payara Micro in separate JVM process and continues with the Gradle build.

|`immediateExit`
|false
|If Payara Micro is executed in daemon mode, the executor thread will wait for the ready message before shutting down its process. By setting `immediateExit` to `true` you can skip this and instantly interrupt the executor thread.

|`javaPath`
|`java`
|Absolute path to the java executable.

|`deployWar`
|false
|If the attached project is of type WAR, it will automatically be deployed to Payara Micro if `deployWar` is set to `true`.

|`javaCommandLineOptions`
|_none_
|Defines a list of command line options that will be passed to `java` executable. Command line options can either be defined as key-value pairs or just as list of values. key-value pairs will be formatted as `key=value`.

|`commandLineOptions`
|_none_
|Defines a list of command line options that will be passed onto Payara Micro.

|`hotDeploy`
|false
|Enables the hot reload mode.
|===

[[stop]]
=== `microStop`

*Aim*: This task stops Payara Micro with the specified configuration. By default this task tries to find out currently executing Payara Micro instance based on project GAV. If `processId` is defined, it will take precedence and the given `processId` will immediately kill the executing Payara Micro instance.
*Usage*: `gradle microStop`

.Configuration tags
[cols="2,1,7",options="header"]
|===
|Element
|Default
|Notes

|`processId`
|_none_
|Process id of the running Payara Micro instance.

|`useUberJar`
| false
|Use created uber-jar that resides in build\libs folder. The name of the jar artifact will be resolved automatically by evaluating its final name.
|===

[[reload]]
=== `microReload`
*Aim*: This task reloads the Payara Micro application with the specified configuration. By default, this task performs the vanilla deployment of the application without restarting the Payara Micro instance. If `hotDeploy` is set to true then the Hot Reload functionality will be enabled. 
*Usage*: `gradle microReload`

IMPORTANT: This task is specifically designed for integration with the IDEs and Editors. Payara Micro instance allows IDEs to deploy the application in Hot Deploy mode by reusing the existing application instance and updating its classloader and internal components relative to the modified source. This can lead to significant savings of time when an application is redeployed and boost developer productivity even more.

.Configuration tags
[cols="2,1,7",options="header"]
|===
|Element
|Default
|Notes

|`hotDeploy`
|false
|Enables the hot reload mode.

|`sourcesChanged`
|_none_
|Defines a list(comma separated) of the absolute paths to the source file which need
to be reloaded via the Hot Reload feature.

|`metadataChanged`
|false
|If set to true, reloads deployment descriptors metadata in hot deploy mode

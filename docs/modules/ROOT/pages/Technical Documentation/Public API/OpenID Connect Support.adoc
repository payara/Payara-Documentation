[[openid-connect-support]]
= OpenID Connect Support

The Payara API provides a `@OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition` annotation that creates an authorization mechanism for OpenID Connect support. This works in the same way as other authorization mechanisms in the Java EE Security API.

[[usage]]
== Usage

The OpenID Connect authentication mechanism is defined through the `@OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition` annotation. Specifying this in a valid place as defined by the Java EE Security API will create the mechanism.

[[usage-example]]
=== Example

Here's an example that configures a OpenID Connect client:

[source, java]
----
@OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition(
       providerURI = "https://sample-openid-server.com",
       clientId = "87068hgfg5675htfv6mrucov57bknst.apps.sample.com",
       clientSecret = "{my-secret}",
       redirectURI = "${baseURL}/callback",
       extraParameters = {
            "testKey=testValue",
            "testKey2=testValue2"
       }
)
public class SecurityBean {

}
----

See https://github.com/javaee-samples/vendoree-samples/tree/master/payara/openid[this sample project] for a more detailed example.

When defining a OpenID Connect flow within an application deployed on Payara Server, it is possible to retrieve the access token, identity token, user claims and the other authentication information within any bean in the scope of the callback/redirectURI resource used to configure the authentication:

[source, java]
----
@WebServlet("/callback")
public class CallbackServlet extends HttpServlet {
    
    @Inject
    OpenIdContext context;
    
    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
        //Here's the caller name
        out.println(context.getCallerName());
        //Here's the caller groups
        out.println(context.getCallerGroups());
        //Here's the unique subject identifier within the issuer
        out.println(context.getSubject());
        //Here's the access token
        out.println(context.getAccessToken());
        //Here's the identity token
        out.println(context.getIdentityToken());
        //Here's the user claims
        out.println(context.getClaimsJson());
    }
}
----

The original protected URL called is stored so that a redirect can be issued to this page after the callback from the OpenIdConnect provider is handled.  

NOTE: Only some basic redirect is supported namely a GET. Only the URL and query parameters are available, not the headers and the request body.

[source, java]
----
@WebServlet("/my-servlet")
public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet{

    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        // handling the OpenIdContext information. See previous example
        // Now return to original requested page
        response.sendRedirect(request.getSession().getAttribute(OpenIdConstant.ORIGINAL_REQUEST).toString());
    }
}
----

[[configuration]]
== Configuration

OpenID Client can be configured with both `@OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition` annotation attributes and Microprofile Config properties.
The annotation and MicroProfile properties has several configuration options.

CAUTION: If you are using MicroProfile Config properties and the value contains a placeholder that should not be resolved by MicroProfile Config
itself but by the Server (like `payara.security.openid.redirectURI=${baseURL}/Callback`) make sure the value is properly escaped. It will otherwise result in `NoSuchElementException`. +
Here's an example how such a value should be escaped: `payara.security.openid.redirectURI=\\${baseURL}/Callback`

The annotation and MicroProfile properties has several configuration options. They are detailed below.

|===

[[el-support]]
== Expression Language Support

The `@OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition` supports the use of expression language (EL) notation for programmatic configuration scenarios. This means that you can use any CDI bean properties to set the OpenID Connect configuration like this:

[source, java]
----
@OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition(
    providerURI="#{openidConfigBean.tokenEndpointURL}",
    clientId="#{openidConfigBean.clientId}",
    clientSecret="#{openidConfigBean.clientSecret}",
    redirectURI="#{openidConfigBean.redirectURI}"
)
public class SecurityBean {
}
----

IMPORTANT: By default, the EL expressions are evaluated only once after the application is loaded and the evaluated values are then remembered until the application is reloaded, for performance reasons. This means that although the configuration can be evaluated dynamically the first time it's needed, it's not possible to change the configuration later on. If you need to dynamically modify the configuration during the lifetime of the application, follow the next section about multi-tenancy support.

[[extraparameters]]
=== Evaluation of `extraParameters`

There are several ways, how to configure `extraParameters` using Expression Language and Microprofile Config.

==== Replaced by MP Config Value
The annotation supports the MP Config value `payara.security.openid.extraParams.raw` (see `OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition.OPENID_MP_EXTRA_PARAMS_RAW`) in form of URL-encoded parameters. If specified, it takes precedence. Example of the value, e.g. in `META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` file:
```
payara.security.openid.extraParams.raw=key1=1%2C2&key2=value2
```

==== Replaced by `extraParametersExpression`
The `extraParametersExpression` option was introduced in a manner similar to Jakarta 10 and later. If specified, this option is evaluated as an EL expression, e.g. it expects a bean returning the configuration. If it returns a list of strings, these strings are used in the form `"key=value"`. Values can use further expressions to be configurable at runtime.

Usage:

```
extraParametersExpression = "#{securityBean.extraParametersArray}"
```

[source, java]
----
public class SecurityBean {
    public String[] getExtraParametersArray() {
        return new String[]{"key1=value1", "key2=#{value2}"};
    }
}
----

If the expression results in a single string (e.g. configured via MP Config), it must be in comma-separated format  (`"key1=value1,key2=value2"`). The values are split by commas. Any other type will result in an error.

==== Evaluation of `extraParameters` Itself:
If the previous steps are not present, `extraParameters` are evaluated. They must be in form `key=value`:

```
extraParameters = {"key1=value1", "key2=value2"}
```

Values can use expressions (only one in form `#{` expression `}`):
```
extraParameters = {"key1=#{value1}", "key2=#{value2}"}
```

[[multitenancy]]
== Multi-tenancy Support (Session-scoped Configuration)

By default, the same configuration of the OpenID connector is applied for the whole application, for all authentication attempts. This is for performance reasons. The OpenID connector also supports re-evaluating the configuration for each user session, before each authentication attempt. This is useful in a multi-tenant scenario to define a different configuration for each tenant. It's also useful if the user should be able to select which provider they want to use to authenticate.

To enable re-evaluation of the configuration for each user session, set the MicroProfile Configuration property `payara.security.openid.sessionScopedConfiguration` to `true`. To specify it directly in the application, you can place it in the https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-config-1.4/microprofile-config-spec.html#default_configsources[microprofile-config.properties] file in the `META-INF` directory on the classpath (in a WAR application it could be in `WEB-INF/classes/META-INF`).

With this enabled, it's possible to use EL expressions to dynamically adjust the configuration before each authentication attempt, e.g. based on any information in the incoming HTTP request. The information about the HTTP request can be retrieved from a `HttpServletRequest` object injected using `@Inject`.

IMPORTANT: It's not possible to use a different configuration for just a subset of secured resources. Once a user is authenticated, the authentication information is saved in the HTTP session. All secured resources will be accessed using the same user, having the same roles, until the user logs out.

[[example-multitenant]]
=== Example Multi-tenant Authentication

This example should showcase the following steps:

* Enable session-scoped OpenID Connect configuration
* Resolve the tenant name from an HTTP request query parameter
* Use the tenant name to read the configuration value from the respective xref:/Technical Documentation/MicroProfile/Config/Overview.adoc[MicroProfile Config] property
* Retrieve the value from an EL expression defined in the `@OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition` annotation

TIP: The tenant can also be resolved from a cookie, which is set the first time a user loads the application; from the domain name in the URL (if different tenants use a different domain name to access the same application); from a path prefix that follows the context root and prepends all application URLs (e.g. `contextroot/tenant1/index.xhtml`, `contextroot/tenant2/index.xhtml`).

. Create a file `microprofile-config.properties` in your application (for a WAR application it would be in the `WEB-INF/classes/META-INF` directory), with the following contents:
+
.microprofile-config.properties
[source, properties]
----
payara.security.openid.tenant1.providerURI=<TENANT1_OPENID_PROVIDER_URI>
payara.security.openid.tenant2.providerURI=<TENANT2_OPENID_PROVIDER_URI>
payara.security.openid.sessionScopedConfiguration=true
----
+
This will provide configuration for `tenant1` and `tenant2` tenants. For each additional tenant, add a new line for its `providerURI`.

. Create an `OpenidConfigBean` class with the `tokenEndpointURL` method. This class will be a CDI bean that injects `HttpServletRequest` to get information about which tenant to use. It will also inject `Config` to retrieve the configuration about each tenant from the `microprofile-config.properties` file:
+
.OpenidConfigBeanEL.java
[source,java]
----
@Named
public class OpenidConfigBeanEL {

    @Inject
    HttpServletRequest request;

    @Inject
    Config config;

    private static final String BASE_OPENID_KEY = "payara.security.openid";

    public String getTokenEndpointURL() {
        String tenant = getTenant(request);  // a custom method to decide which tenant to use
        return config
                .getOptionalValue(BASE_OPENID_KEY + "." + tenant + ".providerURI", String.class)
                // e.g. payara.security.openid.tenant1.providerURI for "tenant1" tenant
                .orElseGet(() -> {
                    // read config for the "tenant1" tenant by default
                   return config.getValue(BASE_OPENID_KEY + ".tenant1.providerURI", String.class);
                });
    }

    private String getTenant(HttpServletRequest request) {
        return request.getParameter("tenant"); // resolves the tenant name from a query parameter
    }

}
----

. Finally, configure the OpenID Connector using the `OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition` annotation that references the `getTokenEndpointURL()` in an EL expression:
+
.SecurityBean.java
[source,java]
----
@OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition(
        providerURI = "#{openidConfigBean.tokenEndpointURL}",
        clientId = CLIENT_ID_VALUE,
        clientSecret = CLIENT_SECRET_VALUE,
        redirectURI = "${baseURL}/Callback"
)
public class SecurityBean {
}
----

[[logout]]
=== Logout functionality

With the `logout` parameter of the `OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition` you can define the behavior when the user logs out of the application and defines how the RP session is managed.

.Configuration Options
|===
| Option | MP Config property | Required | Description | Default value 

| `notifyProvider`
| `payara.security.openid.provider.notify.logout`
| `false`
| Notify the OIDC provider (OP) that the user has logged out of the application and might want to log out of the OP as well.

If `true` then after having logged out the user from RP, redirects the End-User's User Agent to the OP's logout endpoint URL. This URL is normally obtained via the `end_session_endpoint` element of the OP's metadata or can be customized via `fish.payara.security.annotations.OpenIdProviderMetadata#endSessionEndpoint`
| false

| `redirectURI`
| payara.security.openid.logout.redirectURI
| `false`
| The post logout redirect URI to which the RP is requesting that
   the End-User's User Agent be redirected after a logout has been
   performed. If redirect URI is empty then redirect to OpenID connect
  provider _authorization_endpoint_ for re-authentication.
| 

| `accessTokenExpiry`
| `payara.security.openid.logout.access.token.expiry`
| `false`
| Whether the application session times out when the Access Token expires.
| `false`

| `identityTokenExpiry`
| `payara.security.openid.logout.identity.token.expiry`
| `false`
| Whether the application session times out when the Identity Token expires.
| `false`
|===

A programmatic logout is performed by calling `OpenIdContext#logout()` which invalidates the RP's active OpenId Connect session.

If `fish.payara.security.annotations.LogoutDefinition#notifyProvider` is set to true then it redirects the End-User's User Agent to the `end_session_endpoint` to notify the OP that the user has logged out of the RP's application. It will also ask the user whether they want to log out from the OP as well.

After a successful logout, the End-User's User Agent redirects back to the RP's `_post_redirect_uri_` configured via the `fish.payara.security.annotations.LogoutDefinition#redirectURI` property.

[[proxy-support]]
=== Proxy Definition 

Using the `proxyDefinition` parameter of the `@OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition` annotation, you can specify details regarding proxy mapping within the OpenID Connect client configuration. It contains attributes to specify the `hostName` and `port` of the proxied server. This addition facilitates the configuration of proxy mapping for requests traversing through reverse web proxies.

Moreover, the proxy configuration details (`hostName` and `port`) can be dynamically utilized to define the `redirectURI` within the annotation configuration, replacing the `baseURL` placeholder if present. This allows for a more flexible setup, especially in scenarios involving reverse web proxies.

[[scenarios-without-proxy]]
==== Scenarios without Proxy

* *Case 1*
** `redirectURI` employs the `${baseURL}` placeholder, which defaults to `${baseURL}/Callback` when `redirectURI` is not explicitly defined.
** Proxy definition is also absent.
** -> *Outcome*: The generated `redirectURI` should include the request's host and port.
+
The registered Authorized Redirect URI in Google Cloud must contain a URL with the Payara Server instance's host and port.

* *Case 2*
** `redirectURI` is explicitly defined with the Payara Instance's host and port.
** Proxy definition is not present.
** -> *Outcome:* The registered Authorized Redirect URI in Google Cloud must contain a URL with the Payara Server instance's host and port.

[[scenarios-with-proxy]]
==== Scenarios with Proxy

* *Case 3*
** `redirectURI` employs the `${baseURL}` placeholder, defaulting to `${baseURL}/Callback` when `redirectURI` is not explicitly defined.
** Proxy definition is included.
** -> *Outcome:* The generated `redirectURI` should include the proxy's host and port. The registered Authorized Redirect URI in Google Cloud must contain a URL with the proxy's host and port.

* *Case 4*
** `redirectURI` is explicitly defined with the Payara Server instance's host and port.
** Proxy definition is also present.
** -> *Outcome:* The registered Authorized Redirect URI in Google Cloud must contain a URL with the Payara Server instance's host and port.

* *Case 5*
** `redirectURI` is explicitly defined with the Proxy's host and port.
** Proxy definition is included.
** -> *Outcome:* The registered Authorized Redirect URI in Google Cloud must contain a URL with the proxy's host and port.

[[provider-metadata]]
=== Provider Metadata

If the OpenId server doesn't provide autoconfiguration, or it is necessary to customize it, it is possible to set these values in the `providerMetadata` attribute of the `@OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition` annotation.

It's also possible to specify all values by using MicroProfile Config properties. None of the attributes are required in the annotation, but some options are required and must be specified either in the annotation or a MicroProfile property or must be provided by the OIDC provider.

TIP: The order of evaluation is: MicroProfile Config ->  `@OpenIdProviderMetadata` -> automatic configuration on `providerURI` address.

When these values, which correspond to lists (e.g. `scopesSupported`, `responseTypesSupported`), are loaded from MicroProfile Config, they are separated by a comma, following link:https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-config-2.0/microprofile-config-spec-2.0.html#_array_converters[MicroProfile Config Array conventions].

[[secret-alias]]
== Client Secret Aliasing

The client secret can be input directly, or for added security it can be aliased using any of the following features:

* xref://Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Server Configuration And Management/Configuration Options/Password Aliases.adoc[Password Aliases]
* xref:/Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Server Configuration And Management/Configuration Options/Variable Substitution/Types of Variables.adoc[Environment Variables / System Properties]
* xref:/Technical Documentation/MicroProfile/Config/Overview.adoc[Config API]

[[fetch-caller-data]]
== Fetch Caller Data

As the OpenId Connect Client is built on top of Jakarta EE Security API, therefore `javax.security.enterprise.SecurityContext` interface can provide caller info which is available as a CDI bean and can be injected into any context-aware instance.

The Payara Platform Public API also provides a `fish.payara.security.openid.api.OpenIdContext` interface which is also available as a CDI bean and consist of the following methods:

- The `getCallerName()` method - Gets the caller name of the currently authenticated user.
- The `getCallerGroups()` method - Gets the groups associated with the caller.
- The `getSubject()` method - Subject Identifier. A locally unique and never reassigned identifier within the Issuer for the End-User, which is intended to be consumed by the Client.
- The `getTokenType()` method - Gets the token type value. The value MUST be `Bearer` or another token type value that the client has negotiated with the authorization server. 
- The `getAccessToken()` method - Gets the authorization token that was received from the OpenId Connect provider.
- The `getIdentityToken()` method - Gets the identity token that was received from the OpenId Connect provider.
- The `getRefreshToken()` method - Returns the refresh token that is used by OIDC client to get a new access token.
- The `getExpiresIn()` method - Return the time that the access token is granted for, if it is set to expire.
- The `getClaimsJson()` method - Gets the User Claims JSON that was received from the `userinfo` endpoint.
- The `getClaims()` method - Gets the User Claims that were received from the `userinfo` endpoint.
- The `getProviderMetadata()` method - The OpenId Connect Provider's metadata document fetched via provider URI.

[[user-information-from-the-id-token]]
== User Information from the ID Token

The `userClaimsFromIDToken` attribute that belongs to the `@OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition` will instruct the container to retrieve the user information details from the ID Token instead of calling the `userinfo` endpoint, as defined by the OpenID Connect standard workflow.

As such, this behaviour is non-standard and should be used on special cases.

TIP: To properly connect an application with Microsoft ADFS this property is required because by default Microsoft ADFS doesn't allow calls to the `userinfo` endpoint.

.Configuration Option
|===
| Option | MP Config Property Name | Required | Description | Default value

| `userClaimsFromIDToken`
| `payara.security.openid.userClaimsFromIDToken`
| `false`
| Instructs the container to retrieve user information from the ID Token
| `false`

[[disable-scope-validation]]
== Disable Scope Validation

By default, the OpenID Connect connector validates that a scope is reported as a supported scope by the provider. However, some providers support more scopes than they actually report as supported scopes. In order to disable the validation and allow using such scopes, it's possible to use the `disableScopeValidation` property of `OpenIdProviderMetadata`.

See the <<configuration>> section for more details about this option.

[[disable-scope-validation-example]]
=== Example

[source, java]
----
@OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition(
       providerURI = "https://sample-openid-server.com",
       clientId = "87068hgfg5675htfv6mrucov57bknst.apps.sample.com",
       clientSecret = "{my-secret}",
       redirectURI = "${baseURL}/callback",
       providerMetadata = @OpenIdProviderMetadata(disableScopeValidation = true))
public class SecurityBean {

}

[[bearer-auth]]
== Bearer Authentication and Authorization

In order to authenticate and authorize calls between services using the OpenID mechanism, it is possible to use authorization compatible with https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750[RFC 6750]. In this case, the access token presented to the resource service is an JWT token that is used to verify that the caller has access to OAuth2 protected resources.

[[obtaining-token]]
=== Obtaining JWT Token

Obtaining the token is specific to the OAuth provider and the application. The usual approach is using https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.4[Client Credentials Grant], where an application posts its clientId and secret to identity provider and receives access and refresh tokens in return.

[[passing-token]]
=== Passing Token To The Resource Service

The obtained access token is passed with every request to the resource service by adding it into the `Authorization` HTTP header:

----
Authorization: Bearer access__token
----

[[processing-token]]
=== Processing Bearer Authorization

When the `Bearer` authorization header is present in the request, the provided token is verified. It's validated that it comes from the expected issuer and hasn't expired.

NOTE: Compared to the normal browser flow, no groups are automatically assigned to the identity. The reason for this is that machine-to-machine communication tends to be much more fine-grained and services might want to check more claims, such as `audience`.

The resource service is required to map the information in the JWT token to groups utilizing the `https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/8/apidocs/javax/security/enterprise/identitystore/identitystore[IdentityStore]` interface.

The OpenID connector provides the following classes to make this process possible:

`AccessTokenCallerPrincipal`:: Caller principal subclass that contains access to all claims of passed JWT token
`BearerGroupIdentityStore`:: A convenience base implementation of the necessary Jakarta EE security identity store.

[source, java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
@DeclareRoles({"user", "calendar-reader"})
public class Auth0BearerIdentityStore extends BearerGroupsIdentityStore {

    @Override
    protected Set<String> getCallerGroups(AccessTokenCallerPrincipal callerPrincipal) {
        if (callerPrincipal.hasAudience("https://example.org/api/user")) {
            // if the token is for USER api, set this group
            return Set.of("user");
        }
        if (callerPrincipal.hasAudience("https://example.org/api/delegate")
                // delegate API is further constrained by scope
                && callerPrincipal.getAccessToken().getScope().contains("read:calendar")) {
            return Set.of("calendar-reader");
        }
        return Set.of();
    }
}
----

TIP: The Payara Platform also provides similar functionality by way of the MicroProfile JWT Authentication specification, which is limited only to securing JAX-RS resources. On the other hand, the OpenID Connect Bearer Authentication and Authorization feature is better aligned with the OpenID Connect support in Payara Platform and can also be used to secure other web resources like Jakarta Servlets, for example.

[[specific-providers]]
== Integration with Specific Providers

[[google-oidc-integration]]
=== Google Integration

The Payara Public API provides built-in support for Google OpenID Provider via the `@GoogleAuthenticationDefinition` annotation.

[[google-refresh-token]]
==== Request Refresh Token

To enable the refresh token feature, set the `tokenAutoRefresh` to true and add the `access_type` parameter value to `offline` so that application can refresh access tokens when the user is not present at the browser. 

If application requests `offline` access then the application can receive access and refresh token. Once the application has a refresh token, it can obtain a new access token at any time or as older ones expire. Otherwise, If application requests `online` access, your application will only receive an access token

[source, java]
----
@GoogleAuthenticationDefinition(
    providerURI="#{openidConfigBean.tokenEndpointURL}",
    clientId="#{openidConfigBean.clientId}",
    clientSecret="#{openidConfigBean.clientSecret}",
    tokenAutoRefresh = true,
    extraParameters = {"access_type=offline", "approval_prompt=force"}
)
public class SecurityBean {
}
----

[[azure-ad-oidc-integration]]
=== Azure AD Integration

The Payara Public API also provides built-in support for Azure AD OpenID Provider via the `@AzureAuthenticationDefinition` annotation.

[[azure-token]]
==== Request Refresh Token
To receive the refresh token, set the `tokenAutoRefresh` to true and explicitly add the `offline_access` scope to the definition.

[source, java]
----
@AzureAuthenticationDefinition(
    providerURI="#{openidConfigBean.tokenEndpointURL}",
    clientId="#{openidConfigBean.clientId}",
    clientSecret="#{openidConfigBean.clientSecret}",

[[keycloak-oidc-integration]]
=== Keycloak Integration

Keycloak is an Open Source Identity and Access Management Server, which is a OAuth2 and OpenID Connect(OIDC) protocol complaint.

In this section,the basic steps are described to set up a Keycloak OpenId provider:

. Refer to Keycloak link:https://www.keycloak.org/guides#getting-started[getting started documentation] to run and setup keycloak.

. After Keycloak setup done, login to Keycloak admin console and add the new realm by pressing the **Add Realm** button:
+
image:security-connector/oidc/keycloak/add-realm.png[Add Realm]

. Copy the OpenId endpoint configuration URL from endpoint section:
+
image:security-connector/oidc/keycloak/realm-endpoint.png[Realm Endpoint]

. Now add the **Role** that will be used by the application to define which users will be authorized to access the application.
+
image:security-connector/oidc/keycloak/add-role.png[Add role]

. Create the **Groups**:
+
image:security-connector/oidc/keycloak/create-group.png[Create Groups]

. Add the **User**:
+
image:security-connector/oidc/keycloak/add-user.png[Add User]

. After the user is created, set a new **password** for the user:
+
image:security-connector/oidc/keycloak/set-user-password.png[Set Password]

. Now map the user to roles. Click on **Role Mappings** tab and assign the roles to the user from the available roles:
image:security-connector/oidc/keycloak/user-role-mapping.png[User Role Mapping]

. Assign the user to the groups. Click on **Groups** tab and join the groups from the available groups:
+
image:security-connector/oidc/keycloak/join-group.png[Join Groups]

. Create the OpenId Client by clicking the **Client** option from sidebar and press the **create** button:
+
image:security-connector/oidc/keycloak/create-client.png[Create OpenID Client]

Enter the Client ID and select the Client Protocol **openid-connect** and press **Save**.

- After the OpenId client is created change its **Access Type** to **confidential** and enter the valid **Redirect URIs**:

= Administering HTTP Connectivity

This chapter provides procedures for performing HTTP connectivity tasks in the Payara Server environment by using the `asadmin` command-line utility.

Instructions for accomplishing the tasks in this chapter by using the Administration Console are contained in the Administration Console online help.

[[about-internet-connectivity]]
== About Internet Connectivity

The HTTP service provides functionality for deploying web applications and for making deployed web applications accessible by Internet clients, either in a single application server instance or in a cluster of multiple server instances. HTTP services are provided by two kinds of related objects: listeners and virtual servers.

For more information about clusters, see the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/High Availability/overview.adoc[Payara Server High Availability section].

[[about-http-network-listeners]]
=== About HTTP Network Listeners

An HTTP listener, also known as a network listener, is a listen socket that has an Internet Protocol (IP) address, a port number, a server name, and a default virtual server. Each virtual server provides connections between the server and clients through one or more listeners. Each listener must have a unique combination of port number and IP address. For example, an HTTP listener can listen for a host on all configured IP addresses on a given port by specifying the IP address `0.0.0.0`.

A listener can listen on a specific port on all network interfaces by using the IP `0.0.0.0`, and a configured port. Alternatively, the listener can specify a unique IP address for each listener while using the same port.

A virtual server will then be used to select a combination of network listeners to use for an application. For example, Payara Server has two default network listeners for user deployed applications: an insecure listener on port 8080 (`http-listener-1`), and a secure listener on port 8181 (`http-listener-2`).

Because an HTTP listener is a combination of IP address and port number, you can have multiple HTTP listeners with the same IP address and different port numbers, or with different IP addresses and the same port number (if your host was configured to respond to these addresses). However, if an HTTP listener uses the `0.0.0.0` IP address, which listens on all IP addresses on a port, you cannot create HTTP listeners for additional IP addresses that listen on the same port for a specific IP address. For example, if an HTTP listener uses `0.0.0.0:8080` (all IP addresses on port 8080), another HTTP listener cannot use `1.2.3.4:8080`.

The host running the Payara Server typically has access to only one IP address. HTTP listeners typically use the `0.0.0.0` IP address and different port numbers, with each port number serving a different purpose. However, if the host does have access to more than one IP address, each address can serve a different purpose.

To access a web application deployed on Payara Server, use the URL `http://localhost:8080/` (or `https://localhost:8081/` for a secure application), along with the context root specified for the web application.

To access the Administration Console, use the URL `https://localhost:4848/` or `http://localhost:4848/asadmin/` (console default context root).

[[about-virtual-servers]]
=== About Virtual Servers

A virtual server, sometimes called a virtual host, is an object that allows the same physical server to host multiple Internet domain names.

All virtual servers hosted on the same physical server share the IP address of that physical server. A virtual server associates a domain name for a server (such as `www.aaa.com`) with the particular server on which Payara Server is running. Each virtual server must be registered with the DNS server for your network.

NOTE: Do not confuse an Internet domain with the administrative domain of Payara Server.

For example, assume that you want to host the following domains on your physical server: `www.aaa.com`, `www.bbb.com`, and `www.ccc.com`. Assume that these domains are respectively associated with web modules `web1`, `web2`, and `web3`. This means that the following URLs are handled by your physical server:

[source,text]
----
http://www.aaa.com:8080/web1
http://www.bbb.com:8080/web2
http://www.ccc.com:8080/web3
----

The first URL is mapped to virtual server `www.aaa.com`, the second URL is mapped to virtual server `www.bbb.com`, and the third is mapped to virtual server `www.ccc.com`. For this mapping to work, `www.aaa.com`, `www.bbb.com`, and `www.ccc.com` must all resolve to your physical server's IP address and each virtual server must be registered with the DNS server for your network. In addition, on a UNIX system, add these domains to your `/etc/hosts` file (if the setting for `hosts` in your `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file includes `files`).

[[administering-http-network-listeners]]
== Administering HTTP Network Listeners

By default, when Payara Server starts, the following HTTP listeners are started automatically:

* HTTP listeners associated with the virtual server named `server`:

** The listener named `http-listener-1` does not have security enabled.
** The listener named `http-listener-2` has security enabled

* An HTTP listener named `admin-listener`, associated with the virtual server named `__asadmin`. For this listener, security is not enabled.

The following table describes the Payara Server default ports for the listeners that use ports.

[table-default-ports-for-listeners]
.Default Ports for Listeners

[[network-listeners-configuration]]
=== Network Listeners Configuration

NOTE: When configuring network listeners from the admin console, there are some visible configuration options that transparently configure the protocol being used. +
If a configuration property isn't shown here but is visible in the admin console, see xref:#protocol-configuration[Protocols].

Existing network listeners can be configured from the admin console or with asadmin commands. The network listener configurations can be found in the admin console under *Configurations* -> *your-config* -> *Network Config* -> *Network Listeners*.

[[to-create-an-http-network-listener]]
=== To Create an HTTP Network Listener

Use the `create-http-listener` subcommand or the `create-network-listener` subcommand in remote mode to create a listener. These subcommands provide backward compatibility and also provide a shortcut for creating network listeners that use the HTTP protocol.

Behind the scenes, a network listener is created as well as its associated protocol, transport, and HTTP configuration. This method is a convenient shortcut, but it gives access to only a limited number of options. If you want to specify the full range of listener options, follow the instructions in xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/General Administration/http_https.adoc#to-create-an-internet-connection[To Create an Internet Connection].

. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
. Create an HTTP network listener by using the xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/create-network-listener.adoc[`create-network-listener`] subcommand or the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/create-http-listener.adoc[`create-http-listener`] subcommand.
. If needed, restart the server. If you edit the special HTTP network listener named `admin-listener`, you must restart the server for changes to take effect.

[[configure-sni-for-http-listeners]]
=== *Configure SNI for HTTP Listeners*

Server Name Indication, SNI for short, allows you to use multiple SSL certificates with the same IP address. When enabled, the server will look for a certificate in the configured keystore using a nickname that matches the host name requested.

SNI can be enabled by configuring a network listener. Existing network listeners can be configured from the admin console or with asadmin commands. The network listener configurations can be found in the admin console under *Configurations -> <your-config> -> Network Config -> Network Listeners*.

From here, click on the SSL tab, and make sure that the *SNI Support* checkbox is ticked.

IMPORTANT: For SNI to take effect, the network listener must have security enabled by providing a default keypair and certificate, and by checking the *Security* box on the *HTTP* tab.

[[configure-optional-client-authentication-for-ssl]]
=== *Configure Optional Client Authentication for SSL*

In Payara Server, you can configure the SSL protocol of an HTTP listener such that it requests a certificate before permitting a client connection, but does not refuse a connection if the client does not provide one. To enable this feature, set the `client-auth` property of the SSL protocol to the value `want`. For example:

[source,shell]
----
asadmin set configs.config.config-name.network-config.protocols.protocol.listener-name.ssl.client-auth=want
----

[[configure-a-custom-ssl-implementation]]
=== *Configure a Custom SSL Implementation*

xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/General Administration/http_https.adoc#to-assign-a-default-web-module-to-a-virtual-server[To Assign a Default Web Module to a Virtual Server].

For details, click the Help button in the Administration Console from the HTTP Listeners page.

[[administering-http-protocols]]
== Administering HTTP Protocols

A protocol is used by a network listener to determine the nature of the communication expected by the listener. For example, a protocol determines the timeout of a request, as well as whether HTTPS should be used. The reason the protocol is separate to the listener is so that the same protocol configuration can be used to listen on multiple ports.

Existing protocols can be configured from the admin console or with asadmin commands. The protocol configurations can be found in the Admin Console under *Configurations* -> *your-config* -> *Network Config* -> *Protocols*.

Each HTTP listener has an HTTP protocol, which is created either by using the `create-protocol` subcommand or by using the built-in protocols that are applied when you follow the instructions in xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/General Administration/http_https.adoc#to-create-an-http-network-listener[To Create an HTTP Network Listener].

| TLS V1.3 Enabled
a| Whether to enable TLS V1.3 or not. Will be ignored if TLS is disabled.

NOTE: Support for TLS 1.3 is available with JDK 8 versions after JDK 1.8.0u261, unless you’re using Zulu JDK 1.8.0u222 - 1.8.0u252, in which case you’ll also need to use the Java option -XX:+UseOpenJSSE. This option makes OpenJSSE default TLS provider. +
OpenJSEE is a JSEE provider created by Azul to support TLS 1.3 on JDK 8. See TLS 1.3 Support in Zulu 8 with OpenJSSE for more information. Also note that this flag can cause problems with the HTTP/2 support. If you’re using a lower version than 1.8.0u222, checkbox to enable TLS 1.3 will not be visible on the web administration console.

IMPORTANT: You will need to add the following Java Option: -Dfish.payara.clientHttpsProtocol=TLSv1.3 to the asadmin script for TLS 1.3 to work with asadmin CLI. This sets the TLS version to 1.3 which will be used by the asadmin client.
| `set configs.config.server-config.network-config.protocols.protocol.$+{protocol-name}+.ssl.tls13-enabled=[true\|false]`

| Client Authentication
| When enabled, clients will be required to authenticate themselves to the server.
| `set configs.config.server-config.network-config.protocols.protocol.$+{protocol-name}+.ssl.client-auth-enabled=[true\|false]`

| Certificate Nickname
| The alias of the certificate to be supplied on secure requests. The certificate should be present in the server keystore.
| `set configs.config.server-config.network-config.protocols.protocol.$+{protocol-name}+.ssl.cert-nickname=value`

| `set configs.config.server-config.network-config.protocols.protocol.$+{protocol-name}+.ssl.trust-algorithm=value`

| Max Certificate Length
| Maximum number of non self-issued intermediate certificates that can exist in a certification path. Only used if the trust algorithm is set to PKIX.
| `set configs.config.server-config.network-config.protocols.protocol.$+{protocol-name}+.ssl.trust-max-cert-length=value`

| Enabled Ciphers
| A list of the server enabled ciphers. This string is stores as a comma separated list of the enabled ciphers with a `+` or a `-` at the start of each, depending on whether the cipher is enabled or disabled. E.g. `+TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA,+SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA`.
| `set configs.config.server-config.network-config.protocols.protocol.$+{protocol-name}+.ssl.ssl3-tls-ciphers=value`

| TLS Rollback
| Whether TLS rollback is enabled or not.
| `set configs.config.server-config.network-config.protocols.protocol.$+{protocol-name}+.ssl.tls-rollback-enabled=[true\|false]`

| HSTS Enabled
a| Whether HSTS is enabled. When enabled, the server will respond to requests with the `Strict-Transport-Security` header. While these requests often return a 301 directing the client to the secure site, this header instructs the requester to make all connections to this site secure for the next year.

The header takes the following form:

----
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
----

The last 2 attributes are added based on the other HSTS configuration options.

NOTE: HSTS can be enabled on any HTTP listener. However, it's meant to be enabled on a secure HTTP listener if an insecure HTTP listener redirects to the secure listener. When browsers receive the `Strict-Transport-Security` header over HTTPS, they will use HTTPS immediately for all future connections requested over plain HTTP. +
If the header is retrieved over HTTP, it is ignored by browsers due to security reasons. More information in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security[MDN Docs].
a| `set configs.config.server-config.network-config.protocols.protocol.$+{protocol-name}+.ssl.hsts-enabled=[true\|false]`

NOTE: When the configuration value is set to true, the HSTS header is added with a max-age property value of 31536000. The max-age property is not configurable.

| HSTS Subdomains
| When enabled in combination with HSTS, `Strict-Transport-Security` headers will include the includeSubDomains attribute. When this is configured, the client will also assume subdomains of the targeted resource require secure connections. The subdomains property is not enabled by default and has to be enabled with the following command:
| `set configs.config.server-config.network-config.protocols.protocol.$+{protocol-name}+.ssl.hsts-sub-domains=[true\|false]`

| HSTS Preload
| When enabled in combination with HSTS, `Strict-Transport-Security` headers will include the `preload` attribute. When this is configured, the domain of the target resource will be added to the browser `preload` list, meaning that initial requests to this resource in future won’t be insecure. The `preload` property is not enabled by default and has to be enabled with the following command:
| `set configs.config.server-config.network-config.protocols.protocol.$+{protocol-name}+.ssl.hsts-preload=[true\|false]`

[[administering-virtual-servers]]
== Administering Virtual Servers

A virtual server is a virtual web server that serves content targeted for a specific URL. Multiple virtual servers can serve content using the same or different host names, port numbers, or IP addresses. The HTTP service directs incoming web requests to different virtual servers based on the URL.

Just as multiple network cards in a single PC make the network see them as separate hosts, virtual servers allow one physical server instance to appear as many, enabling multiple domain names to be associated with the same server.

When you first install Payara Server, a default virtual server is created. You can assign a default virtual server to each new HTTP listener you create.

Web applications and Jakarta EE applications containing web components (web modules) can be assigned to virtual servers during deployment. A web module can be assigned to more than one virtual server, and a virtual server can have more than one web module assigned to it. If you deploy a web application and don't specify any assigned virtual servers, the web application is assigned to all currently defined virtual servers.

If you then create additional virtual servers and want to assign existing web applications to them, you must redeploy the web applications. For more information about deployment, see the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Application Deployment/Overview.adoc[Payara Server Application Deployment section].

You can define virtual server properties using the `asadmin set` command. For example:

[source,shell]
----
asadmin set server-config.http-service.virtual-server.MyVS.property.sso-enabled="true"
----

Some virtual server properties can be set for a specific web application. For details, see "xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Application Deployment/Elements of Deployment Descriptors.adoc[payara-web-app]" in the Payara Server Application Deployment section.

[[virtual-server-configuration]]
=== Virtual Server Configuration

Existing virtual servers can be configured from the admin console or with `set` asadmin commands. The virtual server configurations can be found in the admin console under *Configurations* -> *your-config* -> *Virtual Servers*.

image::http/virtual-server-config.png[Configuration Page Location]

The following fields can be configured:

.Virtual Server Configuration
[header, cols="2,6,8"]
|===
| configuration settings  | Description | Asadmin Command

| ID
| The unique ID for the virtual server. The only field which cannot be altered from the admin console. The ID cannot begin with a number.
| `set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.$+{virtual-server-name}+.id=value`

| Hosts
| A comma separated list of values allowed in the host request header to select this virtual server. Each virtual server with the same connection group must have a unique host for that group.
| `set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.$+{virtual-server-name}+.hosts=value,value2`

| State
a| The enabled state of the virtual server. There are 3 options for this property:

- *On* -> This means that the virtual server is active and will be ready to serve requests.
- *Off* -> This means that the virtual server is inactive, and will return a 404 error for all requests made through it. This will look from the outside as if no applications are deployed to this server.
- *Disabled* -> This means that the virtual server is inactive, and will return a 403 error for all requests made through it. This will look from the outside as if the server is intentionally down for maintenance.

| `set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.$+{virtual-server-name}+.state=on/off/disabled`

| SSO
a| Allows multiple web applications deployed to the same virtual server to share the user authentication state. This would mean that signing in to one application would implicitly sign you into all others.

There are 3 options for this property:

- *True* (enabled) -> This enables SSO for applications on the same virtual server.
- *False* (disabled) -> This disables SSO for applications on the same virtual server.
- *Inherit* (controlled by HTTP service) -> This will inherit from the value specified in the *HTTP Service*.

| `set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.$+{virtual-server-name}+.sso-enabled=true/false/inherit`

| SSO Cookie Http Only
| Determines whether to add the `HttpOnly` flag to the `JSESSIONIDSSO` cookie. In practice, this will disallow JavaScript access to the cookie in the browser.

This prevents malicious XSS attacks hijacking a Java session. It is enabled by default.
| `set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.$+{virtual-server-name}+.sso-cookie-http-only=true/false`

| Network Listeners
| Comma separated list of network listeners which applications deployed to this virtual server are available on.
| `set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.$+{virtual-server-name}+.network-listeners=listener-1,listener-2`

| Default Web Module
| This defines which application deployed to this virtual server will be requested if no modules are resolved in the request. For example if `app1` and `app2` have context roots of `/app1` and `/app2` respectively, `app1` will be returned when the user requests `/`.
| `set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.$+{virtual-server-name}+.default-web-module=app1`

| Log File
| This defines a file where log messages coming from this virtual server are redirected to. This allows you to separate application logs from server logs.
| `set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.$+{virtual-server-name}+.log-file=/dir/to/logs/file.log`

| Docroot
| This defines the directory used as the document root for this virtual server. A document root is a directory where static files can be placed and served from.

For example, if you have a web application deployed to `http://localhost:8080/app1` and the corresponding virtual server has a docroot value of `/opt/server/docs`, then requesting `http://localhost:8080/app1/img.jpg` will fetch the file at `/opt/server/docs/img.jpg`.

| `set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.$+{virtual-server-name}+.docroot=/dir/to/docs/`

| Access Logging
a| Enables access logging for this virtual server. Access logging logs all requests made to that virtual server.

There are 3 options for this property:

- *True* (enabled) -> This enables access logging for applications on the same
virtual server.
- *False* (disabled) -> This disables access logging for applications on the
same virtual server.
- *Inherit* (controlled by HTTP service) -> This will inherit from the value
specified in the *HTTP Service*.

| `set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.$+{virtual-server-name}+.access-logging=true/false/inherit`

| Access Log Directory
| Defines the directory used for access logs.
| `set configs.config.server-config.http-service.virtual-server.$+{virtual-server-name}+.access-log=/dir/to/logs`
|===

[[additional-properties]]
=== Additional properties

</glassfish-web-app>
----

NOTE: Setting this property to `true` on Windows systems exposes JSP source code.
| false
| *accessLogWriteInterval*    | The number of seconds between each time the log is written to disk. The access log is written when the buffer is full or when the interval expires. If the value is 0, the buffer is always written even if it's not full. | 300
| *accessLogBufferSize*       | The size, in bytes, of the buffer where access log calls are stored. | 32768
| *allowRemoteAddress*        | Comma separated list of regular expression patterns to which the remote client's IP address is compared. The IP must match one of the patterns to be accepted. | none
| *denyRemoteAddress*         | Comma separated list of regular expression patterns to which the remote client's IP address is compared. The IP must not match any of the patterns to be accepted. | none
| *allowRemoteHost*           | Comma separated list of regular expression patterns to which the remote client's host name is compared. The host name must match one of the patterns to be accepted. | none

| *authRealm*                 | Specifies the name attribute of a security realm, which overrides the server's default realm for standalone web applications deployed to this virtual server. Can be overridden for an individual application with a realm defined in the web.xml. | none
| *securePagesWithPragma*     | Set this property to `false` to ensure that for all web applications on this server file downloads using SSL work properly in Internet Explorer. | true
| *contextXmlDefault*         | Sets the directory of the `context.xml` used for this virtual server, if one is used. | none
| *alternatedocroot_n*        | Specifies an alternate document root, where n is a positive integer that allows specification of more than one. | none
| *send-error_n*             a| Specifies custom error page mappings for the virtual server, which are inherited by all web applications deployed on the virtual server, unless overridden in the web.xml. The value is a string, composed of three values:

- code -> The HTTP response status code for the custom error page.
- path -> The path of the file to be returned, relative to the `/config` directory.
- reason (optional) -> The text of the reason string.

E.g. `send-error_1="code=404 path=/dir/of/file/error.html reason=UNAUTHORIZED"`.

| none
| *redirect_n*               a| Specifies a redirect from an old url to a new one. The value is a string, composed of two values:

* A virtual server named `server`, which hosts all user-defined web modules. For development, testing, and deployment of web services in a  non-production environment, `server` is often the only virtual server required.
* A virtual server named `__asadmin`, which hosts all administration-related web modules (specifically, the Administration Console). This server is restricted, which means that you cannot deploy web modules to this virtual server.

In a production environment, additional virtual servers provide hosting facilities for users and customers so that each appears to have its own web server, even though there is only one physical server.

Use the `create-virtual-server` subcommand in remote mode to create the named virtual server.

*Before You Begin*

A virtual server must specify an existing HTTP listener. Because the virtual server cannot specify an HTTP listener that is already being used by another virtual server, create at least one HTTP listener before creating a new virtual server.

. Ensure that the server is running.
+
Remote subcommands require a running server.
. Create a virtual server by using the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/create-virtual-server.adoc[`create-virtual-server`] subcommand.
+
Information about properties for this subcommand is included in this help page.
. To apply your changes, restart Payara Server.

=== Update a Virtual Server

. List virtual servers by using the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/list-virtual-servers.adoc[`list-virtual-servers`] subcommand.
. Modify the values for the specified virtual server by using the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/set.adoc[`set`] subcommand.
+
The virtual server is identified by its dotted name.

[[delete-a-virtual-server]]
=== Delete a Virtual Server

Use the `delete-virtual-server` subcommand in remote mode to delete an existing virtual server.

. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
. List virtual servers by using the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/list-virtual-servers.adoc[`list-virtual-servers`] subcommand.
. If necessary, notify users that the virtual server is being deleted.
. Delete a virtual server by using the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/delete-virtual-server.adoc[`delete-virtual-server`] subcommand.
. To apply your changes, restart Payara Server. See xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/General Administration/domains.adoc#to-restart-a-domain[To Restart a Domain].

[[to-assign-a-default-web-module-to-a-virtual-server]]
=== To Assign a Default Web Module to a Virtual Server

A default web module can be assigned to the default virtual server and to each new virtual server. To access the default web module for a virtual server, point the browser to the URL for the virtual server, but do not supply a context root.

For example:

[source,text]
----
http://myvserver:3184/
----

A virtual server with no default web module assigned serves HTML or JavaServer Pages ( JSP) content from its document root, which is usually `domain-dir/docroot`.

To access this HTML or JSP content, point your browser to the URL for the virtual server, do not supply a context root, but specify the target file.

For example:

[source,text]
----
http://myvserver:3184/hellothere.jsp
----

[[assign-a-virtual-server-to-an-application-or-module]]
=== Assign a Virtual Server to an Application or Module

You can assign a virtual server to a deployed application or web module.

*Before You Begin*

The application or module must already be deployed.

. In the Administration Console, open the HTTP Service component under the relevant configuration.
. Open the Virtual Servers component under the HTTP Service component.
. Select the virtual server to which you want to assign a default web module.
. Select the application or web module from the Default Web Module drop-down list.

[[to-set-jsessionidsso-cookie-attributes]]
=== To Set `JSESSIONIDSSO` Cookie Attributes

Use the `sso-cookie-http-only` and `sso-cookie-secure` virtual server attributes to set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` attributes of any `JSESSIONIDSSO` cookies associated with web applications deployed to the virtual server.

Use the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/set.adoc[`set`] subcommand to set the value of the `sso-cookie-http-only` and `sso-cookie-secure` virtual server attributes.

The values supported for these attributes are as follows:

`sso-cookie-http-only`::
A boolean value that specifies whether the `HttpOnly` attribute is included in `JSESSIONIDSSO` cookies.
+
When set to `true`, which is the  default, the `HttpOnly` attribute is included. When set to `false`, the `HttpOnly` attribute is not included.
`sso-cookie-secure`::
A string value that specifies whether the `Secure` attribute is included in `JSESSIONIDSSO` cookies. Allowed values are as follows:
+
* `true` — The `Secure` attribute is included.
* `false` — The `Secure` attribute is not included.
* `dynamic` — The `Secure` attribute setting is inherited from the default ports table for all HTTP listeners first session participating in SSO. This is the default value.

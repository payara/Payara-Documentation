= Data Grid Configuration

This section details the multiple configuration settings available for both the Data Grid 

[[enabling-hazelcast]]
== Enabling and Disabling the Data Grid

The data grid is enabled by default in Payara Server. It can be disabled and re-enabled either through the Admin Console, or by using a command line _asadmin_ command.

[[enabling-hazelcast-admin-console]]
=== Disabling the Data Grid via the Admin Console

From the Admin Console homepage:

. Select Data Grid under the instance's configuration from the page tree:
+
image::hazelcast/hazelcast-admin-console-select-instance-config.png[Admin Console Data Grid Config]

. Un-check the **Enabled** option (and optionally check the **Dynamic** option to apply the configuration without the need for a restart) and save.
+
image::hazelcast/hazelcast-admin-console-enable-hazelcast.png[Admin Console Data Grid Enabling]

CAUTION: Disabling the Data Grid in a configuration object will disable the Data Grid for all instances using that same configuration. If this change is applied dynamically and multiple instances are restarted, there is big risk in incurring on data loss. If this is a problem, ensure not to select the dynamic option and restart each affected instance manually in turn.

[[enabling-hazelcast-asadmin]]
=== Disabling DataGrid using Asadmin

The `set-hazelcast-configuration` asadmin command can be used to enable or disable Hazelcast and therefore the Data Grid. This command is also used to configure other aspects of Hazelcast, which is covered in this same section. The command requires the Admin Server to be running, and will expect it to be listening on port **4848** unless specified differently with the asadmin utility `--port` option.

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-hazelcast-configuration --enabled=false
----

If no target is specified, the command will disable Hazelcast on the domain configuration `(server-config)` which equates to the DAS. To disable Hazelcast on another instance, configuration or cluster, use the `--target` option like so:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-hazelcast-configuration --enabled=false --target=${Target}
----

The `dynamic` option of the asadmin command defaults to true, so to enable Hazelcast and require a restart of the target instance/cluster, use `--dynamic=false`:

CAUTION: Same as above, dynamic restarting of multiple instances can incur in data loss, so keep this in mind.

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-hazelcast-configuration --enabled=false --dynamic=false
----

[[hazelcast-settings]]
== Domain Data Grid's Hazelcast settings

Payara Server supports configuring Hazelcast through the Admin Console and asadmin commands. The Hazelcast configuration file can also be directly edited, but will not be covered in depth in this section.

Configuration of Hazelcast is divided into four sections. The first section  applies to the whole domain, the second section applies to specific configurations and therefore to Payara Server instances that use that configuration, the third section covers how certain settings can be specified when a domain is created and the final section covers how to configure config specific Data Grid Start Port during or after the creation of an instance.

Using a Hazelcast configuration file will cause the settings set via the Admin Console and _asadmin_ commands to be ignored. Any parameters not specified in the configuration file reverting to the Hazelcast defaults, even if they are specified in the Admin Console or _domain.xml_ 

IMPORTANT: The https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/resources/hazelcast-default.xml[Hazelcast defaults settings] are not necessarily the same as the Payara Server's Hazelcast default settings).

NOTE: Payara Server uses its https://github.com/payara/Payara/blob/master/nucleus/payara-modules/hazelcast-bootstrap/src/main/java/fish/payara/nucleus/hazelcast/PayaraHazelcastSerializer.java[own serializer] instead of the default Hazelcast one. Setting a global serializer will not override it. This is by design, implemented to avoid a https://github.com/payara/Payara/issues/759[bug] that causes `ClassNotFoundException` issues.


[[setting-hazelcast-configuration-file]]
=== Setting a custom Hazelcast Configuration File

A custom Hazelcast configuration file can be either set using Admin Console or asadmin CLI.

[[setting-hazelcast-configuration-file-admin-console]]
==== Setting a Hazelcast Configuration File with the Admin Console

To set the Hazelcast configuration from a Hazelcast Configuration file:

. Select the domain Data Grid configuration from the page tree and click the *Configuration* tab to view the _"Hazelcast Configuration"_ page:

. On the _Hazelcast Configuration_ page, add the path to your Hazelcast configuration file and click "Save". This path is relative to your domain configuration directory:
+
image::hazelcast/hazelcast-admin-console-set-configuration-file.png[Hazelcast Set Configuration File]

[[setting-hazelcast-configuration-file-asadmin]]
==== Setting a Hazelcast Configuration File using asadmin

The `set-hazelcast-configuration` command can be used to set the configuration file:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-hazelcast-configuration --hazelcastconfigurationfile /path/to/file
----

As with the admin console, this path is relative to your domain configuration directory.

[[configuring-domain-wide-hazelcast-with-the-admin-console]]
==== Configuring Domain Wide Hazelcast Settings with the Admin Console

Some Hazelcast configuration settings apply to the whole domain. Navigate to the _Data Grid_ page for the domain wide settings:

image::hazelcast/hazelcast-admin-console-domain-hazelcast-options.png[Data Grid Domain Wide Options]

The following configuration options are available here:

[cols="4,6",options="header",]
|====
|Property |Description
|Restart Data Grid |Determines if the Hazelcast member embedded in Payara will be restarted to apply any changes made
|DAS Bind Address|Explicitly specifies the IP Address the DAS should bind the Hazelcast instance to.
By default, Hazelcast will try to choose the correct bind address from the IP addresses available on the host. If you find the DAS is binding to an incorrect IP Address the correct address can be specified here.
|DAS Public Address|This is the public IP Address that the DAS should use if the DAS is behind a NAT firewall and other Payara Server Instances need to connect via the public NAT address rather than the internal IP Address
|Auto Increment Port| By default the cluster uses the next unoccupied port that is available starting with the start port. When auto-increment is turned off an occupied start port results in a startup failure instead.
|DAS Start Port | The port the DAS uses to run Hazelcast on. If this port is busy, the port specified will be incremented until a valid port is found.
|Network Interfaces | Similar to DAS Bind address by default Hazelcast will choose the correct IP Address to bind to. If you find Hazelcast is binding to the incorrect address a comma separated list of IP Addresses can be specified here.

|Override Configuration File |Specifies the Hazelcast configuration file to use. The path specified is relative to the domain _config_ directory.
If you are using a custom configuration for a cluster or standalone instance (e.g. _cluster-config_), then the Hazelcast configuration file should be placed in the directory with the same name (e.g. `<domain-root>/config/cluster-config`). This will ensure it is replicated to the node during startup.
Using this option to point to a valid Hazelcast configuration file will cause all other options set to be ignored. Any options unset within the Hazelcast configuration file will be set to the Hazelcast defaults.
|Data Grid Group Name | Specifies the Hazelcast group name, to be optionally used to help divide clusters into logical, segregated groups (i.e. _dev-group_, _prod-group_).
|Start Port|The port the other Payara Server instances use to run Hazelcast on. If this port is busy, the port specified will be incremented until a valid port is found.
|License Key |Enables https://hazelcast.com/products/enterprise/[Hazelcast Enterprise] features.
|Host Aware Partitioning |Whether or not to enable http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#grouping-types[host-aware partitioning] for the cluster. Host aware partitioning *must be* enabled on all members of the cluster (including Payara Micro instances) for this feature to work correctly. This is default in Payara Server 5.181 onwards for both Payara Server domains and Payara Micro instances.
|Data Grid Discovery Mode | See xref:/Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Server Configuration And Management/Domain Data Grid And Hazelcast/Discovery.adoc[Discovery Modes]
|====

[[configuring-config-specifc-hazelcast-with-the-admin-console]]
=== Configuring Server Config Specific Hazelcast Settings with the Admin Console

Navigate to the _Data Grid_ page for the specific configuration.

image::hazelcast/hazelcast-admin-console-config-hazelcast-options.png[Data Grid Domain Wide Options]

The following configuration options are available here:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|====
|Property |Description

|Enabled | See xref:/Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Server Configuration And Management/Domain Data Grid And Hazelcast/Configuration.adoc[Disabling Data Grid] for detailed information

|Restart Data Grid |Determines if the Hazelcast member embedded in Payara will be restarted to apply any changes made
|Lite Data Grid Instance|If set to true, cluster members with this configuration will be Hazelcast "lite" nodes, meaning they will not store any cache data locally and rely on other cluster members to store data.
|Config Specific Data Grid Start Port| Sets Data Grid Start Port to the instance. If set to 0 (default) the Domain wide start port will be used instead.
|Public Address for this Data Grid Node|The Public Address to use for this Data Grid Node. Used when the node is behind a NAT
|Instance Group | Instance group name for all Server Instances using the configuration. Future functionality may use this name.
|Hazelcast Instance JNDI Name |The JNDI name to bind the Hazelcast instance to.
|JCache Manager JNDI Name| The JNDI name to bind the JCache Cache Manager to.
|JCache Caching Provider JNDI Name|The JNDI name to bind the JCache Caching Provider to.
|Executor Pool Size| The thread pool's size for the Hazelcast Executor service
|Executor Queue Capacity | Queue Capacity of the Data Grid Executor Service. Executions are queued until a thread is available
|Scheduled Executor Pool Size| The thread pool's size for the Hazelcast Scheduled Executor service
|Scheduled Executor Queue Capacity | Queue Capacity of the Data Grid Scheduled Executor Service. Executions are queued until a thread is available
|====

Enter your required values, and click _Save_. Restarting the domain or instance/cluster is not necessary for any changes made to take effect, provided that _"Dynamic"_ remains set to "_true_"

[[configuring-hazelcast-on-domain-creation]]
=== Configuring Hazelcast on Domain Creation

The following options can be used with the `create-domain` command to specify certain Hazelcast settings when a domain is created:

[cols="3,1,4,1,1",options="header"]
|====
|Option|Type|Description|Default|Mandatory

| `--hazelcastdasport` | Port Number | The port to run Hazelcast on for the DAS. If this port is busy and auto-increment option is enabled, the port specified will be incremented until a valid port is found. The `--hazelcastdasport` option cannot be used with the `--portbase` option. The `--hazelcastdasport` option overrides the `hazelcast.das.port` property of the `--domainproperties` option. | 4900 | No
| `--hazelcaststartport` | Port Number | The port the other Payara Server instances use to run Hazelcast on. If this port is busy and auto-increment  option is enabled, the port specified will be incremented until a valid port is found. The `--hazelcaststartport` option cannot be used with the `--portbase`  option. The `--hazelcaststartport` option overrides the `hazelcast.start.port` property of the `--domainproperties` option. | 5900 | No
| `--hazelcastautoincrement` | Boolean | By default the Data Grid uses the next unoccupied port that is available starting with the start port. When 
auto-increment is turned off an occupied start port results in a startup failure instead. The `--hazelcastautoincrement` option overrides the `hazelcast.auto.inrement` property of the `--domainproperties` option. | 5900 | No
|====

The following domain properties have been added  to the 'create-domain' command to make it possible to configure certain Hazelcast setting when a domain is created:

[cols=(,,,,),options="header"]
|====
|Property|Description
| `hazelcast.das.port` | This property specifies the port number of the port the DAS use to run Hazelcast on. The `hazelcast.das.port` property is overridden by the `--hazelcastdasport` option.

| `hazelcast.start.port` | This property specifies the port number of the port the other Payara Server instances use to run Hazelcast on. The `hazelcast.start.port` property is overridden by the `--hazelcaststartport` option.

| `hazelcast.auto.increment` | This property specifies whether or not to use the next unoccupied port that is available starting with the start port. When auto-increment is turned off an occupied start port results in a startup failure instead. The `hazelcast.auto.increment` property is overridden by the `--hazelcastautoincrement` option.
|====

NOTE: If the `portbase` options are used, the values for the ports of the Hazelcast DAS start port and the Hazelcast start Port are calculated as follows: Hazelcast DAS start port: _portbase_ + 49 and Hazelcast start port: _portbase_ + 59.

The following examples demonstrate creating a domain with all of the Hazelcast related options:

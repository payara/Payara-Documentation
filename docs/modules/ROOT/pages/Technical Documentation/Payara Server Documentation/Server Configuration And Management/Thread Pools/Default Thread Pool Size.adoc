= Default Thread Pool Size

The thread pool `thread-pool-1` starts with a minimum size of *2* instead of *1* (like in previous versions)

This includes the benefit of allowing users to execute tasks concurrently using the `ManagedExecutorService` and `ManagedScheduledExecutorService` components included with Java EE Concurrency Utilities (https://jcp.org/ja/jsr/detail?id=236[JSR-236]).

Without this change, new tasks submitted to these service components would just have been queued in a linear fashion.

NOTE: This minor optimization is configured on the _default domain_ template (so all newly created domains inherit it).

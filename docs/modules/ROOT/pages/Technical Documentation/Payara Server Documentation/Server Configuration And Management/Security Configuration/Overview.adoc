= Security Extensions

This section documents several extensions made to the security mechanisms and APIs that are provided by Payara Server.

* xref:/Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Server Configuration And Management/Security Configuration/Client Certificates/Advanced Principal Name Configuration.adoc[Certificate Realm: Principal Name]
* xref:/Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Server Configuration And Management/Security Configuration/Client Certificates/Advanced Groups Configuration.adoc[Certificate Realm: Group Names]
* xref:/Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Server Configuration And Management/Security Configuration/Client Certificates/Custom Validators.adoc[Certificate Realm: Custom Validation of Client Certificate]
* xref:/Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Server Configuration And Management/Security Configuration/Multiple Mechanism in EAR.adoc[Multiple HttpAuthenticationMechanism in EAR]

TIP: Payara Platform Enterprise also provides the link:{enterpriseDocsPageRootUrl}documentation/payara-server/public-api/yubikey.html[Yubikey Authentication Mechanism] feature. This allows authentication through a hardware device. This type of authentication removes some need of using credentials and requires authenticating using a physical token in a very secure way.

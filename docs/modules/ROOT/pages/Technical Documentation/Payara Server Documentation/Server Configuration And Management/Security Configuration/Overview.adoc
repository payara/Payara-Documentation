= Security Extensions

This section documents several extensions made to the security mechanisms and APIs that are provided by Payara Server Community.

* xref:documentation/payara-server/server-configuration/security/certificate-realm-principal-name.adoc[Certificate Realm: Principal Name]
* xref:documentation/payara-server/server-configuration/security/certificate-realm-groups.adoc[Certificate Realm: Group Names]
* xref:documentation/payara-server/server-configuration/security/certificate-realm-certificate-validation.adoc[Certificate Realm: Custom Validation of Client Certificate]
* xref:documentation/payara-server/server-configuration/security/multiple-mechanism-in-ear.adoc[Multiple HttpAuthenticationMechanism in EAR]

TIP: Payara Platform Enterprise also provides the link:{enterpriseDocsPageRootUrl}/documentation/payara-server/public-api/yubikey.html[Yubikey Authentication Mechanism] feature. This allows authentication through a hardware device. This type of authentication removes some need of using credentials and requires authenticating using a physical token in a very secure way.

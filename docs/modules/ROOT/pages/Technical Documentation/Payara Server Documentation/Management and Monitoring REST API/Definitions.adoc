== Security

=== simple_auth

Basic authentication using *Username* and *Password* credentials sent using the `Authorization` header.

_Type_ : basic

=== token_cookie
API Key authentication using a session token. In order to retrieve a session token, authenticate using the `simple_auth` security scheme to the `/management/sessions/` endpoint. Pass this token to the respective endpoint setting the `gfresttoken` cookie value.

NOTE: Currently the https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#securityRequirementObject[OpenAPIv2.0] specification does not support cookies to send the API key.

[[description]]
== Description

The `remove-library` subcommand removes one or more library JAR files from \{product---name}.

The `--type` option specifies the library type and the \{product---name} directory from which the library is removed.

The library-name operand is the name of the JAR file that contains the library to be removed. To specify multiple libraries, specify multiple names separated by spaces.

NOTE: The library archive file is removed from the DAS. For common and extension libraries, you must restart the DAS so the library removals
are picked up by the server runtime. To remove the libraries from other server instances, synchronize the instances with the DAS by restarting them.

This command is not supported on the Windows operating system.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

[[description]]
== Description

The `list-clusters` subcommand lists existing clusters in a domain. The list can be filtered by cluster, instance, node, or configuration. For
each cluster that is listed, the subcommand indicates whether the cluster is running.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

[[options]]
== Options

asadmin-options::
  Options for the `asadmin` utility. For information about these options, see the xref:asadmin.adoc#asadmin-1m[`asadmin`(1M)] help page.

target::
  Filters the list of clusters by specifying the target for which the clusters are to be listed. Valid values are as follows: +
  `domain`;;
    Lists all clusters in the domain (default).
  cluster-name;;
    Lists only the specified cluster.
  instance-name;;
    Lists the cluster of which the specified instance is a member.
  node-name;;
    Lists the clusters that contain an instance that resides on the specified node. For example, if instance `pmdi1` in cluster `pmdc`
    and instance `ymli1` in cluster `ymlc` reside on node `n1`, `pmdc` and `ymlc` are listed.
  configuration-name;;
    Lists all clusters that contain instances whose configuration is defined by the named configuration.

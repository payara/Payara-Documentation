= Supported Platforms

Though it is always possible for new versions to be supported, this page details the JVMs currently supported by the Payara Platform (both Payara Server and Payara Micro).

While not all environments are tested, if it is on a supported JVM we will provide support for customers and address issues reported by the community. Similarly, other platforms can always be requested for support.

== Supported Java Virtual Machines

The Payara Platform currently supports the following Java Virtual Machines:

* Azul Platform Core JDK: 8 (u162+), 11 (11.0.5u10+), 17 (17.34/17.0.3+)

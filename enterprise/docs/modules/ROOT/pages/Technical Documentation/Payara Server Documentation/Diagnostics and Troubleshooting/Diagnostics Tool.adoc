= Diagnostics Tool

Payara Server has a diagnostic tool that on demand collects the following information from the server runtime.

* `domain.xml` configuration file
* Server logs
* A JVM thread dump.
* A JVM Heap Dump
* JVM Report

The collection of this data can be targeted towards specific a specific server instance, deployment group or cluster. By default, everything is collected from the DAS, each instance, deployment group and cluster configured in the domain.

If the target(s) is(are) offline, only the `domain.xml` configuration file and server logs will be collected.

NOTE: If you are not using the default _domain1_, you must specify the domain to collect diagnostics from.

[[usage]]
== Usage

The diagnostic tool can be used through the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/collect-diagnostics.adoc#collect-diagnostics[`collect-diagnostics`] Asadmin CLI subcommand, which will collect the relevant data and store it locally in a ZIP bundle that can be used for troubleshooting purposes when raising support tickets on the support portal.

Using this command will allow both customers and support staff to work faster on the investigation and analysis of production and development incidents.

NOTE: The data collected is stored in a ZIP file in your user home directory, the output directory by default.

The resulting compressed ZIP file will have a directory structure similar to the following:

----
deploymentGroup1
├── instance1
│   ├── instance1-domain.xml
│   ├── instance1-jvm-report.txt
│   ├── instance1-server.log
│   └── instance1-thread-dump.txt
└── instance2
    ├── instance2-domain.xml
    ├── instance2-jvm-report.txt
    ├── instance2-server.log
    └── instance2-thread-dump.txt
----

Where the data is grouped in sub-folders segregated in all targets (deployment groups, clusters and instances) scanned by the command.

[[example]]
=== Example

The following example shows how to collect the data of all instances that belong to the `deploymentGroup1` deployment group in the `mydomain` domain:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> collect-diagnostics --target deploymentGroup1 mydomain

Collecting domain.xml from instance2

Collecting Heap Dump from instance2
This version of Payara does not support heap dump generation.

[[remote-collection]]
== Remote Collection

Diagnostics can be collected directly from a remote DAS by specifying the admin port of the target instance (see xref:docs::Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/asadmin.adoc#options[Asadmin Options]), like this:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> -p 24848 collect-diagnostics --target deploymentGroup1 mydomain

[[upgrade-tool]]
= Payara Server Upgrade Tool
:ordinal: 1

IMPORTANT: The Upgrade tool doesn't support migrating from Payara Server Enterprise 5.x installations to 6.x +
This upgrade path will be implemented in a future release of the tool and Server.

This tool can be used to upgrade an existing Payara Server installation to a newer version. The Upgrade Tool is bundled in Payara Server by default and is maintained as a separate JAR artifact under the `fish.payara.extras:payara-upgrade-tool` GAV coordinates.

TIP: The upgrade tool can be manually upgraded to a newer version in case it is needed. To do so, download the latest 2.x JAR release from Nexus using https://nexus.payara.fish/#browse/browse:payara-enterprise-downloadable-artifacts:fish%2Fpayara%2Fextras%2Fpayara-upgrade-tool[this link] and then replace the older version into your Payara Server installation under the `${PAYARA_SERVER_INSTALL}/glassfish/lib/asadmin` folder.

[[commands]]
== Asadmin CLI Commands

The following are the Asadmin CLI commands available to the upgrade tool.

[[upgrade-server-command]]
=== Upgrade Server Command

*Usage*:: `asadmin> upgrade-server`

*Aim*::
This command can be used to upgrade Payara Server to the specified distribution along with all SSH nodes in the `domain.xml` configuration file.

The command will also back up the old version and domains in the default location (`payara6/glassfish/domains`) or the location specified using the `--domaindir` option to allow for rolling back.

[[command-options-1]]
==== Command Options

[cols=",,,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Type |Description |Default |Mandatory
|`--username` |String | The username for the Payara Nexus server.||Yes, unless `--usedownloaded` is specified
|`--version` |String |Specifies the version number of the new version of Payara to use.| |Yes, unless `--usedownloaded` is specified
|`--distribution` |Enum |Specifies the distribution of Payara Server to download. This can payara, payara-web, payara-ml, or payara-web-ml.|payara|No
|`--stage` |Boolean |Determines if the upgrade should be installed in-place, or staged into "_x.new_" directories. Scripts are provided that can be used to apply and rollback the staged install. This option is automatically enabled when running the command on Windows. |False on Unix, True on Windows| No
|`--domaindir` |String |The directory containing the domains. The domains in this directory are backed up, and their config is used to determine the nodes which will also be upgraded. | `${as-install}/domains` | No
|`--usedownloaded` |String |The path to the local Payara Server zip archive to use for upgrading instead of downloading from the Payara Enterprise repository. When this parameter is specified, the `--username`, `--password`, and `--version` parameters are not required.| |No
|=======================================================================

[[upgrade-example]]
==== Example

This example upgrades a Payara Web distribution to version 5.24.1

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> upgrade-server --username example-user --distribution web --version 5.24.1
----

[[rollback-server-command]]
=== Rollback Server Command

*Usage*:: `asadmin> rollback-server`

*Aim*:: This command can be used to rollback Payara Server to the point before the upgrade-server command was run, restoring the most recent backup of the domain (expected to be the backup created during execution of the `upgrade-server` command).

WARNING: This command is not supported on Windows OS, please use the `rollbackUpgrade.bat` script instead.

[[command-options-2]]
==== Command Options

[cols=",,,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Type |Description |Default |Mandatory
|`--domaindir` |String |The directory containing the domains. The domains in this directory are backed up, and their config is used to determine the nodes which will also be upgraded. | $`{as-install}/domains` | No
|=======================================================================

[[staged-upgrades]]
== Staged Upgrades

When the `upgrade-server` command is either used on Windows or with the `--stage` option enabled, the new server files are installed next to the current installation in various _.new_ directories (e.g. `payara6/glassfish/bin.new`). The following helper scripts are available to interact with staged upgrades.

[[apply-staged-upgrades]]
=== Apply Staged Upgrade Script

*Usage*::
`> ./payara6/glassfish/bin/applyStagedUpgrade`

*Aim*::
This script is used to apply an upgrade staged using the `upgrade-server` command.
It will move the current installation into _.old_ directories, and the staged _.new_ installation into the expected "current" location.
It will then upgrade the nodes of the domains in the default domain dir, or the domains in the directory provided using `--domaindir`

[[command-options-3]]
==== Command Options

[cols=",,,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Type |Description |Default |Mandatory
|`--domaindir` |String |The directory containing the domains. The config of the domains in this directory are used to determine the nodes which will also be upgraded. | ${as-install}/domains | No
|=======================================================================

[[rollback-upgrade-script]]
=== Rollback Upgrade Script

*Usage*::
`> ./payara6/glassfish/bin/rollbackUpgrade`

*Aim*::
This script is used to rollback a server upgrade applied using the `applyStagedUpgrade` script.
It will move the _.old_ installation back into the expected "current" location, and the applied upgrade back into _.new_ directories.
It will then rollback the nodes of the domains in the default domain dir, or the domains in the directory provided using `--domaindir`

[[command-options-4]]
==== Command Options

[cols=",,,,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Type |Description |Default |Mandatory
|`--domaindir` |String |The directory containing the domains. The config of the domains in this directory are used to determine the nodes which will also be rolled back. | `${as-install}/domains` | No
|=======================================================================

[[cleanup-upgrade]]
=== Cleanup Upgrade Script

*Usage*::
`> ./payara6/glassfish/bin/cleanupUpgrade`

*Aim*::
This script is used to clean up any leftovers from a staged upgrade: any _.old_ folders and any _.new_ folders will be deleted.

WARNING: Use of this script will prevent you from rolling back or applying a staged upgrade.

[[configure-logging-levels]]
== Configure Logging Levels

The upgrade tool commands and helper scripts will print a set of minimum details of the operations executed (upgrade, staging, rollback). For troubleshooting scenarios, or if wanting to review in detail all executed actions, the following 2 environment variables are available to control the level of logging done by the Upgrade tool:

`AS_DEBUG`:: Set to `true` to configure the Upgrade Tool's logging level to `FINER`.
`AS_TRACE`:: Set to `true` to configure the Upgrade Tool's logging level to `FINESET`.

These variables can also be configured as system properties in the Asadmin CLI script file located in the `{as-install}/bin` folder like this:

[source, shell]
----
AS_INSTALL=`dirname "$0"`/../glassfish
AS_INSTALL_LIB="$AS_INSTALL/lib"
. "${AS_INSTALL}/config/asenv.conf"
JAVA=java
#Depends upon Java from ../config/asenv.conf
if [ ${AS_JAVA} ]; then
    JAVA=${AS_JAVA}/bin/java
fi

exec "$JAVA" -DAS_DEBUG=true  -XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions -jar "$AS_INSTALL_LIB/client/appserver-cli.jar" "$@"
----

IMPORTANT: Remember to turn off these logger level settings after executing a server upgrade, as this setting will affect all future executions of any Asadmin CLI commands, which will cause them to print out more information than usual.
